<span class="drop-cap">R</span><span class="smcap">OUMANIA,</span> Bulgaria, Servia, and the
other new countries situated in the
far East of Europe, are so apt
to be associated in our minds with the
tiresome and unanswered Eastern question,
that we certainly give both land and people
less attention than many of them deserve.
And not least interesting among them all is
Roumania, which during the Turkish war
gained for itself the respect, and admiration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
its stronger brothers and sisters; and which
has, in a graceful fairy tale, been described as
"the spoiled child of Europe" by the lady
who sits upon its throne. Writing fanciful
stories, aphorisms, novelettes, and poems is
this queen's delight, and she has, within the
short time since she began to publish, acquired
for herself a name among German authors.
For she writes in German, which is her native
tongue, and under the pseudonym of Carmen
Sylva, in which she seeks some reminiscence
of the forests that were her earliest and dearest
friends. It was amid the green woods and
the vine-clad hills of the Rhine that her young
intelligence was unfolded; she was born in this
much-sung region, indeed in its fairest part,
and has a true German's pride in that noble
river. As a child she sat for hours upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
lap of the aged patriot-poet, E. M. Arndt,
and he stimulated in her that love of her
native land which was also hers by birthright, for
her princely forefathers had fought and suffered
in the cause of German liberation, and had
never joined the Confederation of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Carmen Sylva, or, more properly, Queen
Elizabeth of Roumania, is the only daughter
of Prince Hermann of Wied Neu-Wied, a tiny
principality situated between Coblenz and
Andernach; and here, surrounded by a devoted,
simple, and cultured family, she spent
her girlhood, whose quiet, even course was only
interrupted at rare intervals by visits to the
Berlin court and travels with her aunt, the
Grand Duchess Helena of Russia. Her parents
were anxious she should be taken out of the
mournful home surroundings, where Sorrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
had taken up an abode she rarely quitted.
Sickness and suffering among those around her
had made Princess Elizabeth early acquainted
with pain.</p>

<p>In the last number of the present cycle the
reader may notice that the tone changes
and becomes elegiac and subjective. Though
slightly veiled, it is impossible to ignore that
this is an autobiography, that the soul of the
queen is laid bare before us; and a fair and
noble soul it is. Indeed, those who are best
acquainted with the details of her life, can
best see how exactly they have been reproduced.
There is, to begin with, her undaunted
courage and desire to know, her love of music,
in which she attained a certain proficiency
under the tuition of Madame Schumann and
Rubinstein, but whose execution she has had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to abandon owing to weakened health, though
the listening to music remains to her a source
of keen delight and enthusiasm. The woods
that surrounded her castle home were, as we
have seen, her earliest and most intimate
friends, to whom she confided all her childish
griefs and aspirations, who alone were allowed
to listen to the lyrics she sang and penned in
secret, who told her fairy tales in the rustling
of their leaves, and who comforted her sorrows.
At the age of eleven (not two years, as the fable
says) it was her lot to witness the nobly borne
death struggles of a most gifted and lovable
younger brother, whose memory has remained
to her a religion, and whose life she has written
for her family, illustrated with over two
hundred paintings from her own pencil. For
five years after the boy's death her mother was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
prostrated upon a couch of sickness, while the
Prince, her father, was a permanent invalid,
suffering from chronic lung disease that grew
yearly more hopeless. Her girlhood's friend,
too, "the fair maiden flower," she saw fade and
die. No wonder her eyes grew weak with
weeping! It was then she was sent traveling
to distract her. While at St. Petersburg she
had a severe attack of typhus fever, and before
she was convalescent she was told that during
her absence her beloved father had been laid
in the grave. Then she grew homesick for the
old house in which she had seen so many die,
and for a long time she was sad and weary of
her life. "Must every thing I love be borne
to the grave?" she asks in a plaintive little
song, written in her diary at that time. In
poetry she found her only outlet, her only consolation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
but as yet she did not publish; these
utterances were for herself alone, to give herself
relief and voice. Then at last she was
aroused to work and duty by the claims of
matrimony, which for a long while she had resisted.
Her desires had not been towards
marriage, and she had once playfully said that
the only throne that could tempt her would be
that of Roumania; there she could find something
for her hand to do. In 1869 Prince Charles
of Hohenzollern asked her to be his bride, and
share with him that newly-founded throne.
And here she did find the work "mountains
high," of which Sorrow tells her; and how
nobly, admirably, wisely she has attacked these
labors, what she has done and does towards
civilizing and educating her half-barbarian subjects,
that lives in their hearts, is repeated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
their tongues, and has already found echo in
song and story.</p>

<p>There stands in the public place of Bucharest
a statue representing the queen in the act of
giving a draught of water to a wounded soldier.
It was subscribed for by the wives of the officers
of the Roumanian army, and intended as
an enduring testimonial of their gratitude to
her whom the popular voice names <i>muma rantilor</i>,
that is, mother of the wounded. For
what she did during the war of 1877-78 is unforgotten,
unforgettable, by her subjects. She
met every train of wounded that came from
the battle-field, she organized hospitals and
convalescent homes, she was present at operations,
she comforted the dying and wept with
the survivors. No wonder her people adore
her, no wonder that it is greatly due to her that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
King Charles is a popular sovereign although
he reigns over a people alien to him in blood
and language. "You will have a noble mission,"
he said to her on the day of their
betrothal; "you must comfort tenderly when
I have been too harsh, and you may petition
for all."</p>

<p>But even after her marriage Sorrow did not
depart from Carmen Sylva's side. She was to
know the joy of being a mother; but not for
many years, as she says, was this high dignity
to be hers. She had to see the grave close
over her child's golden head, and no other has
ever come to comfort her for this loss. Her
greatest treasure, her greatest earthly happiness,
and all her hopes were buried with this
little girl. The sorrow that sprung thence
made her truly a poet and an author. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
translated and published the Roumanian nursery
songs that had been beloved of her child,
hoping that other children in her distant German
home might love them too. She put into
verse the delicate little sayings of her babe, but
those have not been permitted to see the light
of day; she poured into song the whole depth
and agony of her grief. And after having years
ago renounced all such hopes, she found that
Sorrow had made her an artist, and that the
world cared to listen to her speech.</p>

<p>Since 1878 the queen's pen has been most
productive, although indeed what she has given
to the public was not all written since that date.
The stones here reproduced in English dress
quickly gained for her warm friends upon the
Continent, many of whom asked themselves,
how comes it that a woman who occupies a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13-14]</a></span>
throne beside a beloved husband; who is
young, beautiful, and courted; who surely has
beheld life only from its most brilliant side,
can have looked so deep into the human soul,
and learnt to know so well its woes and
struggles? The answer lies in the brief sketch
I have above given of her life. She has drunk
deep from the cup of suffering, and therefore
she could write the tales of "Pilgrim Sorrow."</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_l.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" />
<span class="drop-cap">L</span><span class="smcap">IFE</span> was a radiant maiden, the daughter
of the Sun, endowed with all
the charm and grace, all the power
and happiness, which only such a mother
could give to her child. Her hairs were sunbeams,
her eyes gleaming stars. Flowers
dropped from her hands, seeds sprang into life
from beneath her footsteps; sweet scents and
songs of birds floated around her; from her lips
uncounted songs welled forth. Sounds like the
gurgling of a thousand streams were heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
from out her garments, and yet they were only
made of flower petals and covered with tender
webs, in which numberless dew-drops twinkled.
Glow-worms encircled the royal brow like a
diadem; birds bore her train over rough paths.
When her foot touched thorns they grew green
and blossomed; when she laid her soft hand
upon the bare rock it became covered with moss
and fern. The Sun had bestowed on her glorious
child power over all things, and as companions
and playfellows she had given to her Happiness
and Love. In those days there was
much joy and blessedness on earth, and no pen
can recount, no pencil paint, how glorious it all
was. It was just one eternal May day, and the
august mother looked down from afar upon
her daughter's glad games, and blessed the
earth upon which her child was so happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>But deep down in the earth there lived an
evil spirit called Strife. The Kobolds brought
him news of all the beauty that was outside,
and of the young sovereign who reigned so
proudly and lovingly over the whole world,
and who played so sweetly with Happiness and
Love. First he was angry at the tidings, for
he desired to be sole ruler of all things; but
after a while a great curiosity took hold of him&mdash;and
something beside, something hot and
wild, he knew not himself what. Only he
wanted to get outside at all costs. So he began
to move a mighty rock from the center of
the earth, and he cast it up on high. Then he
kindled a great fire, so that all the rocks and
the metals above him melted and poured their
glowing, scorching streams over the paradise of
earth. And in the midst of these flames Strife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
rose up, clothed in dazzling armor, with flowing
locks and contracted brows. In his hands he
held a great block of stone, and he peered
around him with his piercing black eyes, seeking
what he should destroy first. But of a
sudden he let fall the rock, crossed his arms
over his breast, and stared down upon the garden
of earth, like one in a dream. He stood
thus a long, long while, gazing down, silent
with wonder, like to a statue. Suddenly he
struck his brow with his fist.</p>

<p>"What! I have lived down there, among
cold stones, in the darkness, and outside is such
beauty! What must the sovereign be like to
whom all this belongs?"</p>

<p>The thought brought life once more into this
Titanic figure. He stepped with giant strides
down into the blooming, scented world, treading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
through it like a storm-wind, stamping down the
flowers, breaking down the trees, without knowing
it. He must find the mistress of all this fair
earth. He even passed across the sea, making
it pile up waves tower high, and once more he
climbed a lofty mountain, in his hot impatience
to gain a survey. Then he saw upon a meadow-side
that which he sought so ardently. Resting
her foot upon cloudy, silver-feathered flower
seeds, her garments gathered up around her,
Life was floating by upon her journey from
flower to flower, singing as she went. Upon her
shoulders twittered a pair of birds; upon her
finger she bore a bee, to whom she showed
where the best honey lay hid. She had left
Love behind her in a wood, busy building a
nest, while Happiness was sleeping upon a
mossy bed beside a waterfall after having played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
antics innumerable. Therefore Life was floating
forth alone, singing a morning carol to her
mother the Sun. Of a sudden she beheld something
gleam and glitter in front of her, and
when she raised her eyes, she saw Strife planted
before her, gazing at her fixedly. His bright
armor reflected her glistening tresses. Life
quailed at the sight of this mighty man with
the burning eyes, her foot slipped from its
seed-cloud, which sped on without her. She
would have fallen had she not grasped a birch
branch and slid herself down by it upon a
mossy rock.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried Strife, "have I found you at
last, you who dispute my empire, you who
wield the scepter here on earth? Who are
you, little maiden, who venture upon such
liberties?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>These haughty words restored to Life all her
pride and loftiness.</p>

<p>"I am the child of the Sun, and the earth is
mine; it was given to me by my royal mother,
and all bends before my power."</p>

<p>Speaking thus she threw back her fair head
proudly, so that the Sun lighted up all her face.
Strife saw it and was drunk with love.</p>

<p>"If I overcome you so that you are mine,
then you and the earth will both belong to me."</p>

<p>"Try," said Life, "I am stronger than you."</p>

<p>"I am to wrestle with you, you tender flower!
Well, if I do so I must put aside my armor, or I
shall crush you."</p>

<p>And he did so, laying his shield and armor
upon the grass. Then he sprang at her to encircle
her waist and to lift her into the air. But
at that moment roses sprang forth from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
girdle, and their thorns pricked him so sharply
that he had to let her go. He tried to catch
her by the hair, but this scorched him. Then he
tore off his golden chain and tried to bind her
hands with it. She only bowed her head; then
the chain melted in his grasp. Suddenly he
felt his wrists clasped by her tender fingers. He
tried to shake her off, but she would not let go.
He lifted her from the ground; she only floated
but would not let him loose, and as often as she
grew weary the Sun gave her new strength.
Then he strove to draw her under the shade of
the trees; but these inclined to one side that
the Sun might protect her darling. A whole
day did this wrestling last. At last Strife saw
that the Sun inclined towards setting, and
though she lingered she had to depart. Then
Life lost her strength, but Strife grew doubly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
strong. He shook her off and rushed upon her.
Soon her garments lay torn upon the sward, her
hair lost its scorching might, and before dawn
broke the chaste maiden knelt trembling and
red with shame upon the earth, entreating forbearance
and mercy with sobs and tears. At
this Strife set up a laugh that made the earth
quake, and the rocks re-echoed it like to pealing
thunder.</p>

<p>Terrified, Life sank to earth in a swoon.
Strife raised her high in air in his mighty arms
and bore her away. Her lovely head was bent
back, her hair swept the ground, her lips were
half opened as though no breath were in them,
the wondrous limbs that had resisted him so
long hung faint and powerless, and wherever he
bore her there the grass faded, the leaves decayed
and fell from off the trees, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
blew a storm wind that froze the limbs of
Life.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Strife, and he covered her with
kisses; "you shall warm at my fires. Only I must
hide you from the Sun or I shall lose you again."</p>

<p>And he vanished with her into the mountains.</p>

<p>The whole earth grew barren and desolate,
the birds sang no more, the flowers drooped,
only on the spot where Life had sunk down
fainting there bloomed some crocuses; but
even these could not endure. The Sun grew
pale with grief, and wept and beckoned with a
white sheet that fell upon the earth and dispersed
into thousands of tiny fragments, while
the mountains upon which Strife's armor had
lain became ice for all time.</p>

<p>When Love and Happiness found that they
had lost Life they began to roam the world in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
search of her, asking all things after their beloved
companion. They no longer recognized
their earth garden in its changed form, and they
wept bitterly. They wandered past hill and
dale, alongside the rivers that lay frozen and
ice-clad, and they called aloud for Life, for they
deemed that they must find her. One day they
leant wearily against a tall rock, when of a sudden
they heard a sound within it as of gurgling
waters. Flushed with joy they looked at one
another and both exclaimed: "Here she is,
here; we hear sounds of Life," and they began
to touch the rock and to call and listen round
about it, until they found an opening whence a
spring gushed forth. Softly they called "Life,"
and there she stood before them, joyless, downcast,
with weary steps, laying her finger upon
her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lord slumbers, do not wake him," she
whispered sadly.</p>

<p>"Dear Life, come out with us; your garden
is bare, your mother is pale, and we have
roamed so long in search of you. Oh, come
forth once more."</p>

<p>And they drew Life forth with them, and as
she took the first step outside snowdrops
peeped up, and at her next step violets bloomed,
and as she laid her weary hand upon a tree
the buds swelled and broke into leaf.</p>

<p>"Behold," cried Love and Happiness, "you
still have your old might. Oh, do be joyous!
Look up at the Sun that she, too, may
laugh."</p>

<p>But when the Sun saw her child so weak and
weary, she could not refrain from weeping,
though she strove to smile and warm her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
daughter with her hot rays. Again and again
she had to press her cloud-sheet before her
eyes, and then her tears dropped down upon
the earth. Life still crept along, but wearily.
Then came a swallow.</p>

<p>"Hold on to my wings, dear Life; I will
bear you a bit;" and thus she once more floated
through the blue air, until the swallow was tired.
Then the stork came and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kneel on my back and put your arms
round my neck; I will carry you further."</p>

<p>And he bore her far, far, and wherever he
alighted a babe was born, and Love and Happiness
followed in their wake, and dwelt beside
the child. And the whole earth grew green
and bright. The birds sang again, and every
sunbeam gave new power to Life, so that once
more she could stand on the mountain tops, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
blooming, splendid woman, full of grace and
majesty, with earnest eyes and serious mouth,
her hands filled with the fruits that should make
rich the world.</p>

<p>But deep down in the earth, Strife who had
awoke long ago, sought for his absent wife. He
stormed out into the world, and every where he
beheld her traces, but herself he could not find.
How many of her gifts did he not destroy in
his wild haste! Sometimes he would halt
puzzled, piercing the distance with his stern
looks. Ay, he was near despairing, for she,
from whom he could no longer live apart, fled
from him ever. Now a tree hid her with his
foliage, now a bird in his nest, now a flower
beneath its leaves, now the mist in its veil; and
if he came too near to her an eagle would bear
her on his pinions up to the Sun, until Strife had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
swept past below, when she returned endowed
with new power and glory. But at last, at last,
he did catch sight of her as she was pressing a
vine wreath upon the locks of Happiness, and
sending a gleam from her forehead into the eyes
of Love. Then he stepped before her, looked
at her and beckoned. He must have done
something to her, for of pride and resistance
there was no longer a trace. He strode before
her without looking round, and she bowed her
lovely head and followed him; and when her
comrades would have held her back, she only
beckoned with her hand, and stepped after him
silently, wrapped in robes of mist that swept
the falling leaves, and was like to an echo of
the gurgling that had once sounded in her robes.
She went into the mountain, bearing with her
fruits and grapes, that the Kobolds pressed into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
wine with which they made to themselves merry
days.</p>

<p>And she brought forth two children, a boy
and a maid. Both were very pale, and had
large dark eyes. The boy had something wild
about him, like his father, the maid was tender
like her mother; she was named Sorrow, but he
was called Death. Sorrow did not remain long
in her rocky home. She had inherited from
her mother a yearning for earth, and from her
father a ceaseless unrest. So she wandered ever
backwards and forwards upon the earth, and
never returned to her home. The boy followed
now his father, now his mother, now his sister,
and he made all still and dead upon their
paths; the birds grew still and dead, the ears of
corn grew empty, the children pale; still and
dead all who struggled and suffered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>His mother could only behold him with a
shudder; he inspired his father with malicious
joy, but only his sister loved him. She ever
called him to her, and wept when he would not
come. One day he said to Sorrow, "I must
kill my mother; ay, if she only looks at me she
is dead. But she ever turns aside from me."</p>

<p>Sorrow was terrified at these words, and did
all in her power to turn the mother's gaze from
the son. But she ever felt his might, and could
no longer play with Love and Happiness as
formerly. They both, too, feared Life's awful
son even more than her grim spouse, for over
him they had learnt to exert a certain power;
he grew quieter in their presence. But Death
remained ever inexorable; his glance now
scorching like the simoon, now numbing like
the north; even the Sun lost her strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
before this terrible boy, for he laid night upon
all eyelids, and froze all things living.</p>

<p>Since that time there is an end of the earth's
paradise. That is why Life is no longer a
radiant maiden, but a grave woman, full of
useful power, of stern demands on that which
she has created. She cannot forget how fair
all was once, and fain would see it thus again,
notwithstanding Strife and Sorrow and Death.
She would fain be stronger than all these three,
and yet she must succumb and begin again
anew, to succumb again, ever and ever.</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_s.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" />
<span class="drop-cap">S</span><span class="smcap">ORROW</span> was a lovely slender child,
with dark hair that framed her pale
face. Her delicate lips were nearly
always closed, her black eyes looked deadly
weary, so that none could behold her without
weeping. The poor child had no home, and
wandered restlessly from place to place. Now
she entered the hut of the poor, now the palace
of the rich. She was so silent and sad that all
received her, but, strange to tell, all who
looked at her were attacked with a great woe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
One lost his only child, another his honor, his
property, a third was pursued by enemies without
a cause. Again, another knew but grief
from his children, so that he grew gray before
his time. Or strife arose between married folk,
or one of the family fell prone upon a sick bed
and did not arise thence for years. People looked
at one another astounded whence came so
much affliction, and knew not that they themselves
opened the doors to pale, silent Sorrow,
and called her to their table. Sometimes the
poor child came back by the same road and
learnt what terrible gifts she had bestowed.
Then she avoided for a long time visiting at the
same houses; but she had grown to love some
people, and longed to see them, and did not
notice that she visited them too often. So
grief upon grief befell them, until the sad child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
took up her staff and bade them farewell with
heavy heart and streaming eyes. She went on
her road quietly, not in haste, not hurriedly,
and yet her step was faster than the mountain
stream, faster than the west wind, so that at
last she came to lodge with every human being.
It was most terrible when she attached herself
to children. Then the poor little things got
long illnesses or even became orphans, and their
pretty faces grew pale and delicate, like to
Sorrow's face, and their eyes as sad and heavy.
When Sorrow saw this she would weep bitterly,
and for a long while would look at no child, ay,
even turn her head aside when children were at
play.</p>

<p>One day she lay beneath an apple-tree, and
saw how the little apples had such merry red
cheeks, that it made one glad to look at them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear apple-tree," said Sorrow, "give
me such merry red cheeks, then people will like
better to look at me."</p>

<p>"No," said the apple-tree, "if you had merry
red cheeks, people would no longer harbor you
from pity."</p>

<p>She got up sadly and pursued her road.
Then she came to a garden hard by a river, in
which there was such song of birds that it made
one's heart leap for joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear little birds," cried Sorrow,
"give me some of your lovely song, that I
may make mankind glad."</p>

<p>"No, dear child," twittered the birds; "if
you did not come so silently and go so quietly,
men would not forget you so soon, and begin
to notice that you are Sorrow, and bring them
grief."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet further roamed poor Sorrow and
came to a tall wood. Its scent was delicious,
and it was so pleasant to walk on the thick
moss beneath the trees. Here and there sun-gleams
stole through the whispering foliage,
and trembled and danced upon the moss, gilding
the faded leaves. It was beautiful! The
child leant wearily against a tree.</p>

<p>"Here I may lodge and bring no grief; here
I may rest, and no one look himself ill at me."</p>

<p>A sunbeam came leaping through the leaves,
looked into the dim, lovely eyes, sprang into
them, illumined them brightly, and pierced
down into Sorrow's very heart. The whole
wood saw the wonderful gleaming of that tender
girlish face, and rustled for pleasure and
admiration. Sorrow did not know that she
had grown more beautiful, but she felt the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sunbeam tremble hot and joyous in her
heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear wood," she cried, aloud, "give me
but a single one of all your thousand sunbeams,
and I shall be happy."</p>

<p>Of a sudden all grew deadly still in the wood;
the trees looked at one another sadly, the sunbeam
fled from Sorrow's eyes, touched a lustrous
lizard, and then hid beneath tall ferns.</p>

<p>"You poor, poor child!" said an old oak;
"a single sunbeam makes you too beautiful,
men would call you too much and often, and
then they would have to bear pains far beyond
their strength. You must remain without
cheer or warmth."</p>

<p>Slowly a hot tear fell upon the woodruff that
grew at Sorrow's feet; it sent up sweet odors
and whispered thanks for this dew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>But the restless maid went further, and she
came to a large silent lake. Here nothing
stirred, only Evening stepped across the waters,
wrapped in shade, while round about him red
rays darted through the lake, and here and
there a star fell into it and remained unmoved
on its quiet expanse. Sorrow dipped her hand
into the waters and laid it on her brow. Evening
came by and whispered, "Good-night;
sleep dreamlessly, forget thy woe." She looked
after him long, and sighed softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Once I found rest in the wood; once I forgot
my woe when the sunbeam was in my
heart; but that is past."</p>

<p>Lost in dreams, the child gazed into the lake
whence blew cool airs, while the nixes floated
in mist across it.</p>

<p>Then Sorrow perceived that a red light fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
into the lake, larger, fiercer than the stars, and
it continued to gleam far into the night. As
she lifted her eyes, she noticed that the light
came from a house beside the water. It was
thickly grown with ivy, and from its high-pointed
window that stood open there shone
this light.</p>

<p>"Strange," thought Sorrow, "I have never
entered here, and yet there is some one watching
yonder."</p>

<p>She made her way to the window. There
sat a stately woman with snow-white locks,
wrapped in a long soft gown. A delicate kerchief
was bound round her forehead. She wrote
sedulously, with firm characters, in a large book.
Her brow was marked with a deep stern furrow,
but about her delicate nostrils and lips there
were signs of tender womanliness and nobility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of heart. Sorrow stood sunk in contemplation.
Then two wondrous gray eyes were uplifted and
looked at her calmly, and a deep melodious
voice said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you not come in, child; I have
waited for you long."</p>

<p>Sorrow entered amazed. She did not often
hear this greeting. Of a sudden she found
herself encircled by soft arms, and the wondrous
woman took her on her lap, kissed her, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Sorrow, you had to find me; I might
not seek you, for I never come uncalled. I am
Mother Patience, and I sit here and listen and
watch. The lake bears to me the voices of all
those who call me. Often and often have I
stepped in your footprints, but alas! not ever."</p>

<p>The furrow in her brow deepened as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
spoke these last words. Sorrow laid her head
on this motherly breast.</p>

<p>"Oh, go with me, ever and ever," she craved,
softly.</p>

<p>"No, child! when you call me then I will
come, and when you are weary turn in here. I
have to write the Book of Life; that gives me
much to do."</p>

<p>Poor little Sorrow remained all night with
the wise mother, and next morning she went
on her journey refreshed and strengthened. The
whole earth was blooming and green, for it was
harvest time. Sorrow looked at the poppies
and the corn flowers and thought&mdash;</p>

<p>"You poor things! now you are blooming
so merrily and gleaming in the sunshine, and
yet to-day you will all be mown down."</p>

<p>Then she perceived a burly maiden, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
stood alone in a field, and mowed as fast as
three men.</p>

<p>"Good morning, pale one," she called to
Sorrow, in roguish tones. "Come here, and
help me."</p>

<p>And so speaking she ran towards her, her
locks flying and her blue eyes laughing like
sunshine.</p>

<p>"But who are you?" she asked, amazed,
when she saw Sorrow's dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I am Sorrow, and I must wander for ever.
And who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Work; cannot you see that? Do you
not see how healthy I am, and what strong
arms I have."</p>

<p>And with that she took up Sorrow like an
infant upon her arms, and ran with her all over
the field, and laughed and shouted gleefully. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
faint tinge of red came over Sorrow's face as
she said smiling&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come with me, do. I may never rest, and
yet I am often so weary."</p>

<p>"That may not be, my little sister, for I must
sleep in order to be fresh again in the day.
But I am in all places, and must laugh, yet
when I see your eyes my laughter is choked.
But when you call me I will come, and remain
behind whence you depart, to make the faces
glad again."</p>

<p>Once more Sorrow stepped forth into the
glittering morning and into the wide wide
world. But Work and Patience kept faith and
became her trusty companions. And many a
time they met together of an evening in the
house by the lake, and read out of the Book
of Life or wrote in its pages.</p>

<div class="gaptop2" />

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_p.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" />
<span class="drop-cap">P</span><span class="smcap">EACE</span> dwelt within a deep, silent
mountain tarn that was unfathomable,
yet reflected, notwithstanding,
the sky's eternal blue. About it tall cliffs
reared their heads, that shone at eve with
rosy sheen, while beyond it was protected
by a dense forest in which an ax had never
sounded. Neither Sorrow nor Strife had ever
come in here; even the wind could find
no entry, for the rocks had pushed themselves
forward so protectingly that Winter also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
had to rest content with shaking in lightly
quite a few of his flakes, for there were warm
springs in the tarn, so Frost had no power over
it. It was ever green and flowering round about
the shore, and the song of birds filled the air.
When Peace lay floating on the quiet surface
of the tarn all the flowering and singing
streamed towards him. Then he would smile
blissfully, and kiss the sunbeams that darted
their warm arms towards him; ay, he would
encircle them and draw them under the water
and play hide-and-seek with them behind the
trees and leaves. He was such a glorious youth
that all things loved him; they loved his blue
eyes, fathomless like the lake whence he arose,
his ruddy lips, his wondrous voice, his happy
laughter. No wonder that the sunbeams sought
him, that the moss trembled with joy when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
stepped lightly across it, that the leaf trembled
that touched his brow, that the deer gazed long
into the stream wherein he had seen his image,
that the elves and nixes could only dream of him.</p>

<p>But one day a sound of weeping and sighing
swept through the forest, as though the trees
made plaint, and from their leaves fell drops and
woke the fair sleeper whom the sunbeams had
lulled to rest. Amazed, he gazed around him.
A girlish figure came towards him, with pale
face and long dark lashes and sad, sad eyes.
She dragged her feet wearily across the moss
and sank down beside him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"I am Sorrow; Mother Patience sends me to
you."</p>

<p>"Who is Mother Patience? and who is Sorrow?
I have never heard of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is much you have not heard of, for
you do not know the world."</p>

<p>Peace smiled. "Do you know it, then?"</p>

<p>Sorrow sighed and nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Look at me," she said, "am I beautiful?"</p>

<p>Peace looked at her long, until he had read
the whole history of the world in the depths of
her solemn eyes. Sorrow felt so blissful as she
gazed at him, and every hour she spent with
him the poor maiden felt warmer about her
heart, and love entered into it with all its power
and might. When evening came Peace had
read every thing. He shuddered.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you are not beautiful."</p>

<p>Sorrow felt her heart stand still. She said
softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then you will not go with me?"</p>

<p>Peace trembled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh no," he said, "not with you. It is so
lovely here."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is beautiful, but the wisest of women
bids me tell you that your realm is too small;
you are born to rule, and she has read in the
Book of Life that a time will come when you
shall reign over all things."</p>

<p>Peace looked thoughtfully down into the
tarn.</p>

<p>"But if I am satisfied with my kingdom
here?" he said. "I am not ambitious, I need
no fame and no might, I have all I require."</p>

<p>"But if the whole world became like this
holy spot, then it would be yet more beautiful,
and you only need to show yourself as
you are to carry off the victory and make it
so."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Peace, and he looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
at her again with his lovely eyes, in whose
depths dwelt rest and purity. Sorrow's heart
stood still until Peace looked away from
her into the water and continued thoughtfully.
"I will go and see for myself whether the world
wants me without having ever beheld my face.
If she calls me I will come, for I will not
fight with her. Farewell, Sorrow. I will test the
world to see if I can found my kingdom in
her."</p>

<p>Sorrow remained lost in wonder concerning
him long after he had vanished from her gaze.
A bird flew over her head towards the evening
sky, flapping its wings as it went. Sorrow fell
on her knees beside the tarn. The waters had
grown dark, and through the forest went a sound
as of sighs. The poor maid trembled like a leaf
in the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, in the realm of Peace, none understood
the woe that shook her breast.</p>

<p>"You are not beautiful," were the words that
sounded to her from all sides&mdash;out of the wood,
the water, out of her own heart-beats. Night
came by gently, and sought her darling whom
she had ever kissed asleep. She only found
Sorrow, and looked at her gloomily.</p>

<p>"What have you done to my Peace?" she
asked, in threatening tones.</p>

<p>"I have fetched him away," moaned Sorrow,
and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>Night frowned yet more darkly.</p>

<p>"In punishment," she said, "you shall
ever seek him and never find him. Now
go!"</p>

<p>Sorrow went forth like to a moaning wind
that rushes through the trees. She wanted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
seek for Peace in the world. For a long, long
while she never visited Mother Patience, for she
now only thought of one and had forgotten the
good mother. Peace hovered over the world
as a bird, and he beheld how Strife and his
children had devastated it. He saw bloody
battlefields, and at sight of the first corpse he
grew so giddy that he was near to fall down
with awe. When he beheld murder his heart
grew sore in his breast, as though he had himself
been wounded, and he flew on, away from
the scene.</p>

<p>He flew over a great city. There he saw a
light burning in an attic window. He looked
in. A pale man sat there, and coughed and
wrote with long white fingers.</p>

<p>"And I, too, shall be great, ay, surely," he
murmured to himself. "I feel it in my breast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
like fire; there is a light in my brain that shall
illumine the world."</p>

<p>"Poor fool," thought Peace; "Ambition is
hunting you to death and you do not know it."</p>

<p>From out a vine-wreathed window there
gazed a lovely girlish head.</p>

<p>Peace thought&mdash;"She is like my elves," and
he flew in.</p>

<p>But how bitterly was he disenchanted.
Flowers and dresses lay about in tardy confusion,
and the fair one maintained that last
evening she had exceeded in charm all others
at the ball. Her sister scolded at all balls; ay,
said the whole world was stupid.</p>

<p>"I wish I was that bird who has just come
in," she added.</p>

<p>"He, oh, he will dirty every thing!" said the
other, and chased him out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>In a lonely house there sat an aged woman,
and read out of a large Bible. Deadly pale her
youngest son rushed into her room. He was
the only one that remained to her this side the
ocean, and he asked her for money; he must have
money or he would shoot himself. The Bible
fell from the old woman's hand, she could not
help the reprobate any more; for though he
knew it not she had already sacrificed to him
all her little wealth and even the very house she
dwelt in.</p>

<p>In a beautiful garden a nobleman tended his
sickly daughter who needed air and light, a very
angel of patience and beauty; meanwhile her
callous mother preferred the idle pleasures of
the drawing-room to the care of her sick child.</p>

<p>In a field Peace saw a number of lads and
maidens cutting corn. They laughed and sang,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and threw down their sickles and seated themselves
beneath an apple-tree to enjoy their midday
meal and rest. Peace flew above them
and settled among the branches to listen to their
prattle until the lads fell asleep, while the
maidens continued to chatter softly. Then a
man came across the field. He wore a broad
brimmed hat, and under it loomed forth his
dark, bad face. He woke the lads with kicks,
he threatened the maidens with his stick, called
them lazy and drove them to their work.</p>

<p>Again, further on he beheld a lovely girl
given to wife to a rich monster, notwithstanding
her pleadings and prayers. He saw sisters and
brothers haggling over the coffin of a father;
even among little children he witnessed strifes
that showed him that they bore within them the
seeds of future passions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Peace flew towards the south, where lovely
girls swung carelessly in hammocks, rocking
themselves and torturing their slaves. He flew
to the north, and beheld a large city full of
light-minded women and unfaithful men, who
rushed from one amusement to another&mdash;now
on the ice, now in the ball-room, now in sledges,
now on or behind the stage. He flew to the far
west, and beheld a rushing and racing after
gain&mdash;restless, endless. He flew to the east, and
saw noble men and women working in exile like
to day-laborers, heavy at heart with cold and
home-sickness. He flew into the desert, and
saw lonely travelers languishing for water. He
flew all over and around the world, but every
where he beheld the signs of pain and struggle.
So he went back to his mountain tarn, and he
resolved never to leave his little realm again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
How amazed was he to behold on its shores a
great monastery, built of huge solid stones, that
made it appear as though it had stood there for
ages.</p>

<p>"I must have been long absent," thought
Peace, as he entered into the convent.</p>

<p>He stepped inside a wide stone cell, whose tall
pointed windows looked out upon his lake and
on the rosy shimmering cliffs beyond. A
young monk sat by an organ, playing and singing
in heart-moving tones, as if he would communicate
to the walls the storm that shook his
soul. An older monk had risen from a table,
on which, as also on the floor, lay strewn open
folios. He seated himself in the window-niche
and covered his face with his hands. Of a sudden
the door was opened, and there entered an
emaciated monk with flaming eyes. His fierce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
regard rested sternly on the younger man.
Then he turned his haggard form towards the
man in the window-niche, and pointing to the
door he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"For you, my son, these sounds are noxious
poison, which only strict penance can remedy."</p>

<p>The man addressed bowed his head and went
out.</p>

<p>"And you, my son, sin daily by your song.
Your life becomes enjoyment in lieu of penitence,
and you lead astray your brethren also.
From to-day forward song and organ are forbidden
you."</p>

<p>And he walked to the instrument, locked it,
and, putting the key in his pocket, he went
away. The younger man fell upon his knees
before the organ and kissed it like a dead bride,
and then went out into the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Peace leant against a beech-tree and wept
passionately. "The whole world is a struggle,
and they have taken from me my only home.
Farewell, my silent lake!"</p>

<p>And once more he went out into the world.</p>

<p>He came past a churchyard and went in, going
from grave to grave till he came to the
chapel, where a woman knelt and sobbed.</p>

<p>"Not even here," said Peace, and turned to
go further.</p>

<p>Then he saw a neglected grave, all overgrown
with trailing ivy. Cross and inscription had
long vanished, the mound had sunk, only the
ivy wound its arms lovingly over the forgotten
spot.</p>

<p>"Here is my kingdom," said Peace, and he
sank down among the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

 <div class="gaptop2" />

<p>But Sorrow yet roams the world in search of
Peace, for she can never forget him. Yet, wherever
she asked, wherever she sought, nowhere
could she find him. Some had seen him go by,
but none had been able to hold him. She passed
through the church-yard, and stepped by
the new graves, only the neglected one she did
not visit.</p>

<span class="drop-cap">W</span><span class="smcap">HERE</span> is Truth? I want to go to
her," said Strife.</p>

<p>"She lives in a castle of rock crystal,
high up above, on the highest mountain in
the world, and looks out thence on all the
lands, and knows every thing, and whosoever
attains thither finds everlasting rest; but I do
not know the road."</p>

<p>So spoke a golden eagle, flapped his wings,
and disappeared into immeasurable heights.</p>

<p>But straight in front of Strife there stood of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
sudden a little being, with turned-up nose, large,
light, prominent eyes that only looked outwards,
and a half-opened mouth, as though she had
just spoken.</p>

<p>"Whence come you?" said Strife.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Whither are you going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know either."</p>

<p>"What do you want in the world?"</p>

<p>"I want to know, for my name is Query."</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to know? Then perhaps you
know the road to Truth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it, and that is why I do not go on
it, for I want to see that which I do not know."</p>

<p>"But Truth knows all."</p>

<p>"Oh no; how can she know? She sits up
there in her castle, while I run about and ask
and ask."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>And she skipped about restlessly as she
spoke. Seeing a flower, she stooped down and
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you grow here?"</p>

<p>"Bah," cried Strife, impatiently, and trod it
down. "What do I care about that! You
are to show me the road to Truth."</p>

<p>"That I will not," cried Query, and ran
away.</p>

<p>With two long strides Strife caught her up,
and seized her by the arm.</p>

<p>"I don't leave go of you till you have led
me thither."</p>

<p>"But I don't know the whole way; I can
only lead you as far as Doubt."</p>

<p>"Then lead me to Doubt."</p>

<p>"I will not," said Query, defiantly, and
tugged at the arm that was captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Strife grew enraged. He tore up stinging
nettles, and lashed her with them until she
promised to do all that he desired. Then he
slung his golden chain round her body, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now lead me and I will follow."</p>

<p>Then she began to lead him astray, on rough
paths, through shrubs and water, and over
rocks, and across the desert. At last she stood
still and laughed at him scornfully, pointing
out with a titter the spot whence they had set
forth. At this Strife grew so furious that even
impertinent little Query began to tremble. And
she had reason to tremble, for he chained her
to the nearest tree and lashed at her with cords
until she could cry no more.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "explain to me how to
reach as far as Doubt, for I will no longer go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
with you. But if you deceive me again I will
strike you dead."</p>

<p>She pointed out the road to him, and he went
away without looking back, leaving her tied to
the tree. She begged and entreated and cried
for help in vain. His mighty form grew smaller
and smaller, the sun scorched her hotter and
hotter. Poor little Query nearly perished.
But the inquisitive swallows, who were her
especial friends, saw her need, and brought her
drops of water and crumbs of bread in their
beaks. This lasted until autumn came, and
they set forth on their wanderings. In her
need she turned to the wind for aid. He began
to blow stronger and stronger, till he had
broken down the tree. Had little Query not
been so lithe and supple, it would have cost
her her life. At it was, she fell to the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
numb with fear and cold. But she soon roused
herself, loosed herself free from the stump, and
ran off as fast as her feet could bear her, to
peer once more with curious eyes into the
world.</p>

<p>Strife had reached Doubt, who lived at the
foot of the mountain where stood the castle of
Truth. His house was surrounded by a large
bog, into which countless persons had sunk who
had sought the road to Truth. Strife hewed
down a whole forest and threw it into the bog,
and then stepped across it to the dwelling of
Doubt.</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried Doubt. "You don't escape
from here without a struggle."</p>

<p>"That just suits me. I came here to wrestle
with you."</p>

<p>So they began to tussle, and they fought together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
for the space of a whole year. Winter
came; they strove upon the ice. Summer
came; they still contended. The wood that
Strife had thrown into the bog began to sink
under the mighty bodies, and it sank deeper
and deeper until it threatened to engulf them.
Then, at last, Doubt gave way, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well go, but it will not be for your happiness."</p>

<p>"I do not seek happiness; I seek Truth,"
said Strife, and began to climb the mountain.
The longer he ascended the higher it seemed
to grow; with immense exertion he climbed
from rock to rock. Beneath him a precipice
yawned continually, and threatened to destroy
him. More than once he had to lay hold of
the stones and pull himself up by them. A
block broke and fell thundering into the deeps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
From time to time it lightened and flashed up
in the heights; that must be the palace of
crystal which Strife had vowed to enter. After
new exertions he reached a wondrous lovely
forest dell, surrounded by tall, aspiring trees.
Within was such scent of flowers, such murmur
of water, such song of birds, that a strange
sensation came over him, while straight in
front, upon a polished rocky point, something
shone like to the sun itself. That was the
castle of rock crystal. Its thousand facets
caught the light and sunbeams, and reflected
them up and down in endless refractions. The
pointed turrets reared themselves against the
clear ether, like ice upon which snow has never
fallen. It was as though light moved about in
it of its own will and power, as though it came
forth thence, and not from the Sun that stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
behind the castle. When Strife shielded
his eyes with his hand in order to endure
the glare, a lovely maiden, clothed only
in her own golden locks, came forth
from the castle and down the hill.
She had laid a huge green leaf across her
shoulders to shelter her from the sun, and was
thus flooded with gold-green light. In her
hand she held a pitcher cut from a single topaz.
In it the wood, the flowers, and her own graceful
image were reflected. Strife watched her
as she placed her small white feet upon the
moss, walking so lightly that she left no trace.
She had cast down her eyes as she neared the
spring. Then Strife came close, and said as
gently as he could&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give me to drink. I am thirsty."</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes with astonishment and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
looked at the strong, dark man. To him it
seemed as though heaven looked at him, so
deep blue, so clear and pure were her eyes.
The long weary road, the fierce struggles, ay,
even the goal that he would reach, vanished
from his memory as he looked at this impressive
beauty.</p>

<p>"Are you Truth?" he asked, at last. "If so
I will worship you."</p>

<p>The rosy child-mouth opened.</p>

<p>"No, Truth is my mother; I am called Innocence.
Do you wish to go to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no, no longer; I will stay with you,
for you are more beautiful than all."</p>

<p>"Am I beautiful?" asked the girl with surprise;
"my mother has never told me that. But
you, you are beautiful, and you look so good,
therefore you shall drink out of my pitcher."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had drunk the draught he was
quite beside himself. He had only one thought,
to win charming Innocence unto himself.</p>

<p>"Come, play with me, thou heavenly child,"
he said; "I can teach you quite new games,
here, on this fair meadow."</p>

<p>And he made balls out of flowers and threw
them at her, and watched her movements as
she caught them laughing and shouting gleefully.
Then he made her run and he ran after.
Then he blindfolded his eyes with leaves, and
she teased him till he caught her. At last she
grew so wanton that she bound him round with
creepers, upon which he made as though he
could not stand, and let himself fall into the
grass. She laughed merrily, and strewed him
with flowers and leaves; but when she had
nearly covered him, he shook himself free,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
sprang up, raised her high into the air, and ran
with her to the wood.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother!" called the terrified
maiden.</p>

<p>Then the sun sank and night covered all things.</p>

<p>Truth sat in her crystal castle and waited for
her daughter. She wondered where the sweet
child could have strayed, and tried to behold
her as she saw all things. But fear for her own
flesh and blood troubled her vision. She passed
her hand before her eyes several times, but she
clearly beheld the sun set and the moon rise so
she could not be blind. When the moon shone
down on her castle, she heard quite distinctly
her child's voice crying in terror, "Mother, my
mother!" and the next moment, with a fearful
crash, the castle of crystal was rent in twain
from top to bottom. Truth grew yet paler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
than the moon that was shining into her face.
She rushed down the mountain. The stream
sparkled in the moonlight, and there lay the
topaz pitcher and a smell of crushed flowers
filled the air. The mourning mother stood
still and asked of Night where was her child,
and all the flowers began to weep and drooped
their heads in sorrow, and soon the whole
meadow was wet with their tears.</p>

<p>Truth went onward, petrified, following the
traces of her child deep into the wood, where
the moon played with the shadows and conjured
forth all sorts of shapes. She went on
and on, till at last she heard a sound of weeping,
and the next moment she stood before her
daughter, who lay on her knees and stretched
out her arms towards her. No one spoke a
word, even Night held her breath; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
eyes of Truth began to glow like flames of fire.
With one look she burnt her daughter's hair,
with the next she dazzled Strife, who stood entranced
and could only stare at her. He felt
the pain of it shoot through all his body, he
put his hand up to his eyes, he tottered and
fell against a tree. He wanted to see; he knew
that Innocence was kneeling there in the moonlight,
but he was stone blind; no ray of light
was ever again to illuminate his darkness. At
last Truth spoke with deep resounding voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"My child, you are torn from me for ever.
Up here there is no longer room for you. Oh
why did you not obey? I had warned you
against every stranger; you were to speak to
none, to give no answers. Here, take my cloak;
at the foot of the mountain you will find shelter."</p>

<p>With these words she turned and went away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and her sighs bent the crowns of the trees, and
grew to a great storm that raged through the
world like an everlasting plaint. Strife stormed
down the mountain and howled with pain and
despair. Since that time he has grown yet
more violent, for he is blind, and rushes through
the world senselessly, trying to wreak vengeance
on it for his eternal pain. Poor Innocence
wrapped the cloak round her trembling limbs,
and descended slowly into the valley. Her feet
were scratched by the rough stones, and her
tears flowed ceaselessly. A few hours ago and
she had been the most lovely flower on the
heights, and now she was crushed and trodden
down. She came to the haunts of men, and
knocked at their doors and asked for alms, but
she got more abuse than alms. At last she
came to the spot where Doubt dwelt, and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
stormy night she passed with light foot over the
bog, not knowing that death yawned under her
feet. Doubt was amazed when he heard a tap
at his door. Who could have crossed the bog
on such a night! There stood a pale tired
woman, and begged for shelter, and said she
would not stay long.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Doubt.</p>

<p>"I am called Innocence."</p>

<p>Doubt laughed a hard short laugh.</p>

<p>"You will not make me believe that."</p>

<p>But as his words made her cry he grew very
somber.</p>

<p>"Is it Strife that has brought you to this? Oh
shame, oh everlasting shame! A curse on him
and his search for Truth. It were better he
had been drowned here."</p>

<p>And Doubt received Innocence most kindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and kept her beside him, but he could give her
no comfort. Each of his words only made her
heart heavier, until at last he told her that she
would be a mother.</p>

<p>"Then I shall die," said Innocence.</p>

<p>At the moment her child was born it glided
away like a snake, and hopped and danced like
a will-o'-the-wisp across the bog of Doubt.</p>

<p>"Oh, my child," sighed Innocence, "come to
me, only once."</p>

<p>Then she felt a burning and glowing at her
breasts and a sucking that drained her very
life. And while the little being sucked it gained
charming form, and it had eyes that shone now
black, now green. Innocence felt how it was
draining from her all her heart's blood, and with
a soft sigh she inclined her lovely head in death.
Doubt buried her in the silent bog that covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
her with its dark waters. Then he looked at
the child.</p>

<p>"Shall I murder you, you horrid wretch?
No; the world is ripe for you, you shall live;
go forth and avenge your mother!"</p>

<p>And so saying he threw her into the bog,
across which she slid like an eel, and hopped
out into the world to do as much mischief in
it as possible.</p>

<p>Strife was her special butt; she tempted and
teased and provoked him incessantly, and often
sent him into towering rages. Then he tried
to wring her neck, for he knew not that she was
his daughter. But she always escaped, laughing,
from the blind man, and mocked him.</p>

<p>The world was enchanted with her. It lay
at her feet and adored her as a goddess; and
this goddess was Falsehood.</p>

<span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> sea was running high and was
black as night. Only the crests of
the endless waves glistened in the
lightning that flashed across the heavens. The
storm was raging towards the land and threw
the ships upon the rocks, so that hundreds of
human lives perished in the ocean. Then of a
sudden it seemed as though the storm grew entangled
among the cliffs on the shore, and
condensed into a form that reared up tall and
pale against the mighty heavens. It was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
grave youth with unflinching black eyes, who
leaned upon a sickle and held an hour-glass in
his hand. He gazed across the waters with an
indifferent air, as though the wrecks, and
corpses beneath, concerned him as little as the
sand in his glass, which trickled down evenly,
steadily, regardless of the blustering of the
storm, or the sudden quiet. There was something
iron-like in the youth's features, in his
eyes there lay a power that destroyed all things
they looked upon; even the ocean seemed to
be numbed by them, and to grow silent with
fear. Day dawned, and flooded with roseate
hues from the rising sun. Sorrow came stepping
over the cliffs. She stretched out her arms to
the youth.</p>

<p>"Brother," she cried, "brother, what have
you done! You have raged terribly, and did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
not hear how I called you, ay, cried for you so
eagerly."</p>

<p>"I heard nothing," said Death. "I felt myself
too quiet, so I roused myself. A few
vessels were lost in the act."</p>

<p>"O pitiless one!" said Sorrow.</p>

<p>"I do not comprehend your grief," answered
the somber youth; and turning from her, he
walked away. He paced silently through the
sunny world; it blew chill around him, and
wherever he paused a silent shudder seized all
things. He went by a house and looked in.
There lay a man tortured with pain who beheld
him and called him imploringly; but he only
shook his head and went further. A lovely
young woman stood in her garden surrounded
by joyous children, her husband had just
stepped up to her and kissed her. The pale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
wanderer laid his hand on her shoulder and
beckoned to her; she followed him a few steps
and sank lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>Then he came to a forest in which a pale
man was pacing hither and thither, tearing his
hair and gnashing his teeth, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dishonored, dishonored!"</p>

<p>He saw the passer-by with the somber eyes,
saw him lift his white hand and point to a tree.
The despairing man understood the signal.</p>

<p>He passed a group of playing children, and
softly mowed the grass between their feet with
his scythe. Then they bowed their heads like
broken flowerets.</p>

<p>There an old man sat in an armchair, and
was enjoying the warming sunbeams. Death
raised his hour-glass and held it before his eyes&mdash;the
last sands were running down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>He halted by a stagnant pool. No water
could be seen, for it was covered with green.
The rushes quivered under his cold breath, and
the toad that had been croaking grew silent.
Then the reeds rustled and a lovely woman
drew close to the water, took something from a
handkerchief and threw it down. It sank with
a faint gurgle into the depths. Twice she
made a movement as though she would spring
in after it, but each time Death extended his
scythe towards her, and she fled terrified. He
lifted his hour-glass in which the sand ran down
quickly, hurriedly. Then something white
came up between the green water-plants, and
with wide-open eyes a little corpse appeared,
gazing at the running sand.</p>

<p>Then Death went further, and across a battle-field,
where he mowed down many fine men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he came to a lovely valley in which
autumn was reigning in all its glory. The trees
were bathed in gleaming gold, the sward beneath
was a luscious green, strewn with tender
flowers. A silvery laugh came from the
branches through which a charming little figure
was floating, now hiding among the leaves, now
jumping down upon the grass, and at last running
with lightsome step, and garments streaming
in the breeze, to meet a stately man who
stood leaning on a club beside a hillock.</p>

<p>"Come to me, fair Happiness," he cried
aloud. "You must go with me. You are mine,
for I am Courage."</p>

<p>"Must I?" said the sweet little form, and
turned her back to him.</p>

<p>As she did so her eyes, full of beaming wantonness
and measureless roguery, turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
towards the pale pilgrim. He saw the dimples
that played on her chin and cheeks, her neck
and her arm. Her whole slender figure was inwrapt
by her light floating locks, which were
moved by the softest breeze, and which
looked in the sunshine like falling gold-dust.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Courage, "you must, for you
love me. I have found that out."</p>

<p>"I love you in this fair valley, and that is
why I give you smiles; but if you must go out
into the world, you must go alone. There
stands one who has never yet spoken with me,
and he looks as if he too needed the gift of
smiling."</p>

<p>"You can't give it to him," said Courage.
"Do not try. You will only hurt yourself with
his scythe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>But Happiness had already run up to the
Inexorable.</p>

<p>"Shall I teach you how to smile, you serious
youth? You seem to need it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I could use it, for all behold me unwillingly,
and no one goes with me unless he is
obliged, and it is because I cannot smile."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Happiness, and she grew quite
timid; "but in order to teach you smiling, I
must kiss you. That does not seem to me so
hard, only your eyes terrify me."</p>

<p>"Then I will close them," said Death.</p>

<p>"No, no, you are so pale, I shall be still more
afraid; and your scythe, too, is so sharp and
cold."</p>

<p>"Then I will throw it from me."</p>

<p>And he threw his scythe far away; it grazed
the trees as it fell. Then their golden foliage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
fell to earth, and all the branches grew bare, and
as the scythe sank into the grass it grew covered
with rime, and the flowers hung down their
crowns.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have spoilt my garden with your
ugly scythe," cried Happiness; "and I was
going to make you such a lovely present."</p>

<p>"I did not want to do it, but the scythe flew
out of my hand, and now I am much sadder
because I have grieved you. You can find new
gardens, but no one can teach me how to smile."</p>

<p>"You shall learn, notwithstanding," said the
fair maiden, and she stepped close to him; but
as often as her rosy lips approached him she
grew so cold that she fell back shuddering.
Then he looked at her imploringly without
raising his hand, as if he feared to hurt her by
a touch; but his gaze held her spellbound like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
a great power, and she had to kiss him. But at
the moment that her lips touched him his cold
sank deep into her heart, and she fell dead to the
earth. Courage sprang angrily at the pale youth.</p>

<p>"You have murdered my Happiness."</p>

<p>"Was she yours?" asked Death, and sighed;
"then go after her; there she floats."</p>

<p>Following the indication of his hand, Courage
saw how the soft breezes were tenderly bearing
away Happiness upon their wings, like to a light
cloudlet. Courage hurried after them with
powerful steps, keeping his eyes ever fixed on
that rosy cloud.</p>

<p>Death stood and gazed until he felt quite
warm within, and a tear ran slowly down his
pale cheeks. He had to learn for himself, what
as yet he knew not, how it hurts if we chase
away Happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>When nothing more could be seen but bare
trees, faded grass, and withered flowers, he lifted
his scythe and looked sadly around the valley,
as though he expected it would all bloom again.
But the earth remained dead and stark, so he
turned once more to the sea. That was rolling
its eternal tides upwards and downwards, as
indifferent as ever. But he who stood above
and looked down was no longer indifferent. He
thought of the maiden whom he had hurt, and
his yearning was as great as the ocean at his
feet. And this yearning transfigured him to
wondrous beauty. Thus he was seen of a pale
maiden with unkempt hair and torn garments.
She fell at his feet; but he was terrified by her,
and drew back a pace.</p>

<p>"Do you no longer know me?" said the
maiden. "You used to know me well, and you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
knew that I perished for yearning after you. I
am Despair. Have you forgotten that you
promised to kiss me, to give me one single kiss?
It would be happiness for ever."</p>

<p>The youth's eyes grew dark as night, and his
voice sounded stern as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you dare to speak of happiness? Do
you know what happiness is? If you come
near it only once may you be turned to stone!"</p>

<p>"And if I were to turn to stone, yet I implore
for a kiss from your mouth."</p>

<p>The youth shuddered and thought of the lips
that had touched his and taught him to smile,
and as he thought of them he smiled. When
the maiden at his feet saw this, she threw her
arms about his neck, and laid her head on his
breast. She did not see the hate and loathing
that flashed from his eyes, but the next moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101-102]</a></span>
a hideous skeleton grinned at her, and nearly
crushed her in his bony arms, and a death's-head
kissed her.</p>

<p>Then the earth trembled and opened. Cities
vanished, fire streamed forth from mountains,
forests were uprooted, rocks flew through the
air, the sky was on fire, and the sea rolled in
upon the land. When all was still again, Despair
reared above the waters, an image of stone. Death
rushed away as a storm wind to pursue
the rosy cloud under this disguise.

<span class="drop-cap">M</span><span class="smcap">OTHER PATIENCE</span> was once again
sitting by her window writing. She
had often been called that day,
and had much to confide to her mighty
folios, much too that was good and pleasant;
that is why an air of cheerful calm rested on
her features. The whole room was filled with
the scent of lovely flowers, and on the hearth
there burnt a bright fire that threw magic lights
and shades upon the industrious scribe. Without
it was blowing cold, and like sharp needle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>points
the frozen snow flew against the window
panes. A light covering of ice lay over the
lake, firm enough to hold the ravens. The distant
road resounded hard and dry under the quick
steps of shivering wanderers, the wind sang melancholy
tunes round the lonely little house, as
though he would recount to Mother Patience
all the misery of the earth. He shook and
tussled at the ivy that tenderly inwrapt the
house. Suddenly she stopped to listen; a light,
well-known footstep had passed her window,
and the next moment Sorrow knelt at her feet,
breathless, trembling like a hunted deer.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said, "mother, how terrible.
Why were you not there, then that awful woman
would not have gone with me, and it all would
not have happened."</p>

<p>So speaking Sorrow looked behind her fearfully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
as though that pursued her that had
alarmed her so.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, child, no awful people come
hither. Tell me what has occurred."</p>

<p>"It was my fault," wailed Sorrow; "I did it.
Oh, why am I in the world? why am I not
there, deep down in the lake where the frozen
water would bury me safely?"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, child, quiet; do not murmur, do
not complain, for you bow down the haughty
and soften the hardhearted."</p>

<p>"No, mother, that is just it; I harden the
hearts, and those who love know each other no
more. You must hear my tale.</p>

<p>"Two years ago I turned in on a prosperous
farm; it was called The Holt. Wherever you
looked you saw evidences of full rich life. The
cattle were well fed and tended like horses, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
barns were full, the maids and men in noisy activity.
A splendid boy with blue eyes and
brown locks was cracking his whip in the yard.
He wanted to chase the calves that were going
to drink. A slender pretty girl with laughing
brown eyes and a coronet of fair plaits came
out upon the doorstep.</p>

<p>"'Johnnie, Johnnie!' she cried; 'you rogue,
you naughty boy; will you leave the calves
alone.'</p>

<p>"The boy laughed and cracked his whip
louder than ever, but swift as lightning the girl
ran out, and with a curious stern look about
her mouth wrenched the whip from him before
he was aware of it, and held it high in the air
so that he could not reach it, though he jumped
and tried. It was a charming picture,&mdash;the boy
impetuously defiant, the girl so firm and lithe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
I looked at both with pleasure. But there was
another looking at them, he seemed to be the
bailiff. When the girl looked round she grew
quite red at the gaze that rested on her, and
called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Why do you stand like that? Could you
not hinder him?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes; but then Willi would not have
flown out like a little demon. I only waited to
see her come out and make her stern face.'</p>

<p>"'Get along with you,' she said, and threatened
him with the whip.</p>

<p>"The bell rang for supper. I was called in
and allowed to sit among the maids. There
stood the Holt farmer, stately and strong. He
had just such brown eyes as his daughter, and
the same stern look about the mouth, only in
him it was more marked. His wife had blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
eyes like the boy, but her air was depressed, as
if she could not hold herself against the strong
wills around her.</p>

<p>"'Johnnie, say grace,' said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Johnnie was cross and mumbled&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Come, Lord Jesus, sit down among us, and
give me back my whip.'</p>

<p>"'But, Johnnie!' thundered the voice of the
farmer, who tried thus to overpower the tittering
that went round the table.</p>

<p>"The tone was a merry one. Johnnie was
much teased, and he swallowed down his vexation
with his hot soup. The bailiff sat opposite
Willi, and they often exchanged secret glances.</p>

<p>"'Johnnie is my crown prince,' said the farmer;
'and he will once reign over all this domain,
while Willi will have all the money and
wed the Raven farmer.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That I will not,' said the girl, without looking
up from her plate, and again that stern
look came into her face; 'I do not like that man.'</p>

<p>"'She does not want to be a raven mother,'<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the head-maid whispered to the bailiff, and all
began to laugh.</p>

<p>"'What is all this whispering?' asked the
farmer, frowning darkly.</p>

<p>"No one would reply. At last Johnnie called
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Willi does not want to be a raven mother.'</p>

<p>"Then the laughter knew no bounds. Willi
threw a censuring look at her brother; the farmer
said dryly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I do not like these silly jokes, and if I say
a thing it must be.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Willi was silent, but under her fair plaits the
same resolve remained.</p>

<p>"Now hear the terrible part. In the same
night that I slept there Johnnie got ill with
fever. The doctor was sent for in haste; the
whole house was upset, and before I could leave
the village that I was leisurely pacing, little
Johnnie grew pale and still, the whole farm
silent as the grave, and only the sobs of women
were heard through the open window as they
laid the boy in his coffin. The farmer's wife was
quite broken down, she wept and moaned incessantly;
the farmer bit his teeth together in
wild grief. Willi did her work, but often passed
her hands across her eyes; only whenever the
bailiff would come near her, she turned her back
and went away.</p>

<p>"It was long before I went that road again; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
could not look at the poor things. Only now
have I passed once more. I wanted so much to
know what the people were doing, and whether
Willi had married the Raven farmer to comfort
her father, since his pride, his darling, his crown
prince lay in the grave. Oh, mother, mother, had
I not brought them misfortune enough! There
they stood, all three, upon the threshold, and the
north wind howled around them. The old
woman was holding her apron before her eyes;
the father was angry like a wild bull. He shook
Willi and turned her adrift with the words&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Away from my house, wench; I know you
not.'</p>

<p>"Willi's face was pale as death, but unmoved.
No sound crossed her lips, no prayers, no complaint.
The door of her home fell sounding
into its lock, and Willi, wrapped in a shawl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
stood outside in the north wind. But under her
shawl something moved, which she shielded tenderly,
and that soon began to cry for its mother's
breast. Then her face grew rather softer, and
she looked anxiously at the little creature with
whom she was thus left alone this wintry night&mdash;she,
the daughter of the rich farmer of The Holt.
She did not seem strong on her feet and had
often to stop by the roadside, now to rest, now
to quiet the child. Thus she went on all night
along the high road till she reached a strange
village. There she sought shelter from the wind
under a porch, seated herself on the stone steps
and fell asleep. But scarcely had day dawned
before she was chased away by the maid who
had come to sweep, and who threw hard words
at her. The wind had abated a little, but she
was so numbed that she tottered on her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"After a while she managed to walk again,
and thus she passed through the whole large
village, over the hard frozen ground, under the
gray leaden sky that grew darker, more glowering
as the day advanced. The child would no
longer be quieted, and cried often and long.
So poor Willi went from house to house and
begged for work.</p>

<p>"'We want no maid with a child,' was the
hard reply she received every where, or 'What
can we do with the little screamer?'</p>

<p>"Then she begged for a little milk for the
babe, for her own was diminishing from hour to
hour. But no one would give her any, and she
wandered on. I went after her, for I could no
longer lose hold of her. Suddenly I saw some
one come up behind me&mdash;a terrible woman, with
stony face and wild hair. She came nearer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
ever nearer, and as she was close upon me she
laughed hoarsely&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You have done your work well. It is my
turn now, for I am Despair.'</p>

<p>"The wind was howling anew, and a snow
storm began that even took away my breath.
Willi thought she had walked away, but in the
dead of the night she found herself once more
at the entrance of the same village. She seated
herself in a hedge half dead with cold and
hunger. The babe in her arms whimpered
unceasingly, only from time to time it cried
aloud. In the morning she roused herself with
an effort, and once more begged for a drop of
milk at various doors. She was scolded anew.
Once a boy gave her a piece of bread, she could
not eat it. She tried twice, three times, to
swallow the hard, cold pieces. Then the child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
whined again. She shook her head and threw
the bread into the snow. Slowly she dragged
herself onwards, till she came near the river,
already covered with a thin crust of ice, on
which lay the fresh fallen snow. The wind
had lulled, but the sky was still leaden gray and
a new snowstorm threatened. The fearful
woman stepped past me towards Willi, who
now stood on the bridge staring down abstractedly.
She laid her hand upon her shoulder.
Willi turned her head slowly; but when she
saw the stony eyes she shrieked and the child
fell out of her arms. I heard the ice crack
and crackle, and then there was nothing more.
Willi lay on the ground unconscious, and
people who were just passing the bridge
peeped down, shook their heads and raised
her up. I do not know where they took her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
beautiful Willi with her wild shock of fair hair
and her bright brown eyes. Oh, mother, what
have I done! Can you not help?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Patience, and looked dreamingly
in front of her, "but I shall help when it
is time."</p>

<p>Winter was past, the world began to stir
anew, the tomtits and blackbirds twittered, in
the fields there was merry life, when Willi
stood before her judges accused of infanticide.
She was white as a sheet, her eyes gleamed
unnaturally from out of dark hollows, and to
all questions she only replied by a shake of the
head. Brow and lips had a strange expression.
Was it the reflection of that terrible face that
had stared at her on the bridge, or of the
thoughts with which she had wrestled in
prison?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>In the whole assembly there reigned breathless
silence and strained expectation. The
judge's voice grew momentarily sharper, more
incisive.</p>

<p>"Do you not know, then, that your life is in
danger if you give no answer?" was sounding
from his lips, when there arose a commotion in
the assembly.</p>

<p>All turned towards the door, by which entered
the Holt farmer. He was bowed down,
his hair was white and there were deep furrows
in his face. When Willi saw him her hand
clutched into a fist, which she raised threateningly.
Of a sudden she let it sink. She knew
not what came to her, but something soft laid
itself round her heart that seemed to melt its
ice. Invisible to all, behind the farmer, some
one else had stepped into court; it was Mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Patience. She saw with a glance that things
were not well for Willi. Like a soft, tender air
of spring, she passed by all assembled, touched
Willi's hard brow, whispered some words to
her counsel, began to dictate questions to the
judge, and stretched out her hand to support
the farmer.</p>

<p>The whole aspect of the room was changed.
Even the pale youth Death, who stood behind
Willi and waited for her, retired a few steps. It
would seem as if this time she would escape him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my child," said the judge, quite
gently, "were you long on the high roads?"</p>

<p>Willi answered firmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I no longer know."</p>

<p>"Were you out at night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was out at night&mdash;two nights, I
think, in a snowstorm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ask none for alms?"</p>

<p>Willi gnashed her teeth.</p>

<p>"I went from house to house, and begged for
milk for the&mdash;for the&mdash;fainting child; but none,
none gave me aught. They scolded me, and
called me bad names, but gave me not one
drop."</p>

<p>A murmur ran through the assemblage.
People from the village were called in who
stated that a person had begged from them for
two days, and had then disappeared.</p>

<p>"She wandered in the snowstorm with a
new-born babe," said the judge, sternly; "and
you gave her nothing?"</p>

<p>"We thought she was a bad woman,"
answered the people.</p>

<p>The judge shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"And then you came to a bridge, and leant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
against it to look into the water. What happened
after?"</p>

<p>Willi shuddered.</p>

<p>"I looked down, and wanted to jump in, but
I was so frozen I could not lift my feet, and
then&mdash;then, some one touched me, and when I
turned round I saw a terrible woman, with a
face of stone, with wild hair, and then&mdash;then I
heard the ice crack below me, and then I knew
nothing more."</p>

<p>The Holt farmer groaned aloud; the listeners
looked at one another; the counsel
began to speak with great eloquence, and bandied
the word "Hallucination."</p>

<p>Willi listened amazed.</p>

<p>"So that is the name of that terrible woman,"
she thought.</p>

<p>Once she gazed at her father. He looked so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
broken that her eyes grew moist and damp, and
a tear rolled slowly down her emaciated face
and fell upon her hand. She did not perceive
that silent, pale Death retreated from her, as
little as she had felt his proximity. She only
looked with weary eyes towards the door that
closed behind the jury. What to her were Life
and Death? But another tear rolled forth as
she looked at her father, who also gazed at the
closed door, as if there would issue thence a
thunderbolt that could kill him. At last, at
last, the men came out and spoke solemnly and
earnestly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not guilty."</p>

<p>Impossible to describe the commotion in the
court. No one was calm save Willi, who leaned
stunned against the wall, and only opened her
eyes when she felt her head resting against a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
beating heart, and two arms flung around her
neck, as they had often been flung when she
was a small, weak child. The Holt farmer
whispered softly into the ear of his rescued
child, words that sank into her heart, as though
no curious crowd surrounded her. When at last
she found words she stammered with dry lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, where is mother?"</p>

<p>Then there flashed a look like sheet lightning
across the old man's face.</p>

<p>"Mother is ill, very, very ill; perhaps we
shall no longer find her."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, father; quick, let us go," said
Willi, and she drew him away so eagerly the old
man could hardly follow.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the farm they stood still
a second; Willi laid her hand on her heart, but
it would not be calmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father," she whispered, "father, I am
afraid."</p>

<p>"I, too," he said softly, from his inmost soul.</p>

<p>Willi re-entered her home trembling, trembling
she stood in the dear old room. There lay
her mother, deadly still, pale as marble; but
Mother Patience had kissed her at the last, and
that was why her white mouth smiled. Willi
knelt by the bed, and her whole body shook
with suppressed sobs.</p>

<p>The farmer stood leaning on his stick in the
doorway; the tears ran down his face. He
knew it, he had himself closed those eyes that
had at last ceased from weeping. Then he
went out, he could look no longer.</p>

<p>Sorrow was in the room; she laid her arm
round Willi and murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"My sister!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother Patience was there too. She stroked
Willi's locks and poured peace into her weary
soul, so that at last she could bear to look at
her dead mother, ay, could even touch the cold
hands with her lips. Then Patience pointed the
way to her father outside, to whom she remained
as sole comfort and support. Ay, Willi
was a strong soul. She began a hard, weary
life with a broken heart and a weakened body.
She had often need to call upon Mother
Patience, when her strength was at an end, and
her father, old and crabbed, demanded too
much from her; when the farm-servants obeyed
her reluctantly and morosely; when the villagers
avoided her at the church door.</p>

<p>She became a mother to the poor, and quietly
did more good than all the villagers together.
Yet all were somewhat in awe of the grave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127-128]</a></span>
stern woman, who was never hard or angry, but
never cheerful. She will not marry, least of
all the man who brought her to shame and deserted
her in her need; her property she will
leave to the orphaned.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Mother Patience, you can work
miracles.</p>

<span class="drop-cap">S</span><span class="smcap">ORROW</span> wanted to rest, so one hot
midsummer's day she climbed lightly
into the high mountains, amid
the ancient forests, high, high up, into the
region of quiet, solemn solitude. Only here and
there a streamlet trickled, or a dry branch that lay
upon the thick moss broke under her footsteps.
From time to time the leaves swayed, as though
the trees breathed; then a sunbeam would creep
through and slide across the fallen mossy giant
trunks upon which younger life was disporting;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
little firs and beeches, strawberries and ants in
dense confusion. Of a sudden there was an
opening, and Sorrow found herself stepping
upon a narrow path, beneath towering rocks, at
her feet a yawning precipice. After a while the
space grew a little wider, and she came to a tiny
house attached to the rock like to an eagle's
eyrie. Beside it, in a niche cut in the living
rock, sat a man with long white beard, leaning
on his stick, and staring with somber dark eyes
down into the valleys that opened out from all
sides.</p>

<p>As far as the eye could reach there was only
mountain and forest. Two eagles hovered
almost immovable in the trembling summer air,
and then flew after each other in slow
circles.</p>

<p>"I am weary," said Sorrow, and seated herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
in the thyme at the feet of the hermit, who
looked at her slowly from top to toe.</p>

<p>"Is that all that you bring?" he asked,
grimly. "You had promised you would sometime
bring me Rest, but I see no one."</p>

<p>"I think she is coming after me," said
Sorrow, dreamily; "the forest is getting so
quiet; but I will not let her come if you do
not keep your promise to me and tell me your
history."</p>

<p>Once again a somber look from out those
black eyes was fixed on Sorrow; then they
looked nervously, searchingly out into the
wood; then the white beard trembled a little,
and dull, muffled tones issued from the man's
chest.</p>

<p>"The price is heavy, but Rest is sweet. In
my youth I was poor and never looked at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
girls, for I did not want to create misery about
me, and I knew hunger and thirst too well to
ask them of my own accord to dwell in my hut.
I was strong as a lion, and industrious, so I
slowly earned a good piece of bread and a house
that I had almost built by myself. Then it occurred
to me that, as youth was nearly past, I
must make haste if I wanted to marry. I knew
a lovely girl, with eyes like a deer, whom a
youth in the village had long desired, but she
had refused him several times, until at last he
saw that she would have nothing to say to him.
Then he had a mind to drown, but he thought
better of it and went to foreign parts, and
nothing more was heard of him. The same
day I wooed Marie, and nearly fainted for joy
when, in answer to my timid question, 'If I am
not too old for you, I should like to have you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
wife, will you be mine?' she answered with
glad eyes, quite softly, 'Most willingly.' I believe
that if one begins to love young, one does
not know what such happiness means. But if
one has been alone for years, and then comes
home and there by the hearth stands a young,
beautiful woman who laughs at one roguishly,
it makes one hot about the heart and head, and
one takes up one's happiness in one's arms and
runs about with it like one demented. You
even cavil with the wind if it blows on your
wife, and you hardly like to suffer the sun to
shine on her. Yes, I was quite beside myself
with love and happiness; and when next year
she presented me with a son, I really had to
tear myself away to go to my work. And the
child had just such eyes as hers, so beaming and
merry. Soon it could stretch out its little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
hands and pull my beard, and then we laughed.
Six years passed thus happily; every day the
boy grew more beautiful and clever, and my
Marie remained merry and young in our little
house by the mountain. True I was passionate
sometimes, but then she would always send me
our boy and I grew quiet at once, for no one
could look into his eyes and be angry, so
angelic was that face with its golden curls.</p>

<p>"One day the rejected wooer returned to the
village; we saw him as we went to church, and
it gave me a pang to see that Marie grew pale
and red and could not cease from looking at
him. It is true that she laughed at me for this,
and said that she was quite proud that I could
even be jealous of the past.</p>

<p>"But I could not forget his look, and why
had she grown red? All the villagers had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
noticed it and smiled, and as it was the younger
men were jealous of me. Nor was there an end
with this first meeting. He insisted on his old
acquaintanceship and visited us often, and as he
had nothing to do, he sometimes came when
my wife was alone at home. I began to be
vexed at this, especially since a horrid old
woman, with a fair young girl, that was as like
you as pea to pea, turned in at our house one
day and warmed themselves by our fire. She
let all sorts of words fall, about evil tongues,
about an old man and a young wife and an
ancient lover, and while she jabbered the girl
looked at me piteously, like you look now&mdash;I
can never forget that look. My wife was in
the bedroom putting our boy to sleep, and as
she was not there to cheer me with her dear
presence, the poison sank deep into my heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
From that hour I grew irritable and passionate
towards her, which made her lose her cheerful
calmness and look nervous whenever the uninvited
guest appeared. I wanted to show
him the door, but she would not allow it, saying
wisely: 'Do you want him to tell the
whole village that you are jealous of him, and
that you mistrust your wife?'</p>

<p>"How many bitter hours he cost us both!
Whenever he had been I scolded Marie till far
into the night. It was her fault; if she were
not so pleasant to him he would certainly not
come again. And I, who formerly would have
let her tread on me, if that could spare her
aught, could now look on coldly when she wept
for hours. Her joyous laughter ceased, and she
always looked at me terrified. I wanted that
she too should feel some of the misery that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
gnawed at my heart, for was it not her fault?
The bad old woman often came through the
forest where I hewed down trees and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Go home, you will find him there.'</p>

<p>"And I did find him once or twice, and at
last I said: 'Marie, if I find him once more,
there will happen mischief; I forewarn
you.'</p>

<p>"And yet again one evil day that old woman
came tramping through the deep snow, and
laughed maliciously and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Go home! go home!'</p>

<p>"I shouldered my ax and ran home. There
stood my wife, and she was red and angry, and
was scolding that man. He only laughed. I
seized him by the breast and swung the ax
over his head. Marie seized me by the arm
and cried&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Think of your son. He shall not have a
murderer for his father!'</p>

<p>"My arm sank. I ran out of the door, far
into the wood. There lay the stems and trunks
I had hewn down, a crust of ice covered the
snow, beneath ran the path that my enemy
must tread to return to the village. I stretched
out my arm and began to arrange the blocks in
such a manner that they would slowly roll down.
One must hit him, I thought, and then he will
be dead, and I shall be no murderer.</p>

<p>"At the first footsteps I heard below I threw
the trunks down, and they followed thick as
hail. I did not look down. Suddenly a cry
that pierced my very marrow rang upon the air.
It was the cry of a child. I grew dizzy. True
I sprang with lightning speed to the spot whence
the cry had come. There lay the golden curls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of my boy pressed in the snow; out of his open
mouth there trickled blood, and his deer-like
eyes looked at me solemnly. I called him by
name; I pressed him to me; I breathed into
his mouth; in vain&mdash;he was dead, dead! I took
him in my arms and bore him home; kicked
open the door with my foot, and gave him to
his mother with the words&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There you have your boy! The tree that
was destined for your friend hit him.'</p>

<p>"She did not cry; she did not moan; she
shed no tears; only her lips grew ashy. She
held the boy for two days on her lap and spoke
no word save a soft&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My child! my child!'</p>

<p>"It had to be taken from her forcibly to bury
it. We did not speak again to one another.
The friend had vanished, and the bad old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
woman, too, did not come again. Other people
soon kept away, as I was so gruff and my
wife so silent. So the days passed, and the
weeks and the months. I might not enter her
room. She begged me to leave her alone. I
think she sat all night long beside the bed of
the child and pressed kisses on his pillow. Day
by day she faded. I did not notice it. It
never occurred to me to send for a doctor.
I wanted no human being to behold our misery.</p>

<p>"One evening she called me with a weak
voice to her bedside, and said calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'To-night I must die, but before I do I
want to confess myself to you. I have hated
you since the hour you killed my joy, and much
though I have struggled, and greatly though I
desired to have pity on you, yet hate was
stronger.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The greater your love for that other,' I
hissed forth.</p>

<p>"She raised her hand in oath.</p>

<p>"'Never; I was your faithful wife until the
end. I thank you for all the happiness of those
first years, and I forgive you the misery of the
last. Kiss me, I love you once more.'</p>

<p>"For the first time I wept and craved her
pardon for all I had done to her. She laid her
hand once more on my brow, sighed a deep
sigh, and was dead.</p>

<p>"Then I ran away into the mountains and
could look at no human being. I wanted never
to speak again, never to hear the sound of
voices. I sought for Rest in the woods, in the
rocks, with the eagles and bears, and yet I
have not found her. My suffering is so great,
I believe the very stars have pity on me. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
old as I am, I cannot forget that I myself
murdered my happiness."</p>

<p>The Hermit had done speaking. All the
hot passions of his past life had been reflected
by his features. Sorrow's eyes had looked at
him fixedly, calmly, pityingly, sympathetically.</p>

<p>Now she beckoned towards the mountains
behind which the sun was about to sink. On
large broad pinions Rest came floating onwards,
looked into the old man's eyes until they
drooped, closed them with gentle hand, breathed
over his rigid features till all traces of bitterness
vanished thence, and the mouth, that was
closed for ever, looked almost gentle. Sorrow
had already vanished. She descended into the
valley and wandered all night. For as often as
she desired to turn the handle of a door, she drew
it back, and thought of the Hermit and his fate.</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" />
<span class="drop-cap">I</span><span class="smcap">T</span> was Christmas Eve. The snow
was whirling in dense masses outside,
and the wind was so strong that
it swept one side of the street quite clean, and
piled up whole mountains of snow across the
way. Through all the windows there gleamed
the bright light of the merry Christmas trees,
and the voices of hundreds of happy children
were heard. Alone and softly Sorrow crept
along in the snowstorm. She turned her eyes
neither to right nor left, that she might throw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
no shadow over these Christmas gayeties; she
was making for a house where there was no joy
to destroy. She passed two children&mdash;a girl in
thin outgrown clothes, and a little boy who
wanted to see all the lovely things that were inside
the houses. His sister raised him up with
all her strength, so that he could grapple hold
of the window-sill, and with enchantment he
looked at all the wonders within. But lifting
her arms had made her poor old dress
crack, and a sleeve came out of its seam.
A tear ran down her face; it froze on her
cheek. Sorrow stroked her head with her
hand.</p>

<p>"I was coming to you," she said; "how go
things at home?"</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>The little one coughs and can barely breathe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and the older sister says the pains in her legs
are so bad with this wind.</p>

<p>"Won't you come home with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said the boy, "it is so beautiful in
there, so bright. Do you hear how they laugh?"</p>

<p>Sorrow did not look up but went further, and
did not notice that Envy was creeping behind
her, with his thin lips and sharp nose and
squinting eyes. He came up to the children
and whispered to them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, it is beautiful in the homes of the rich,
is it not? What have you got, you poor things?
Is it not Christmas too for you?"</p>

<p>"Hu, how cold it is!" the boy said suddenly.
"Come, it is no longer pretty here."</p>

<p>And they ran home.</p>

<p>As they opened the door a haggard woman
called out sharp and impatiently&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quick, shut the door, or all the snow will
come in."</p>

<p>They cowered into a corner behind the
hearth; the woman walked up and down, carrying
a child in her arms that coughed and
choked and gasped for air. In the only bed
lay a feverish girl, emaciated, with unkempt
hair and large restless eyes. Sorrow sat on the
edge of the couch and held her hand; the girl
talked incessantly, softly and quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see it is Christmas, once that was so
beautiful, when things still went well with us.
Then we always had a tree and apples and gingerbread,
and I had a doll that had clothes like
a princess. I liked sewing them for my dolly;
I don't like it now for other people."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"What a pity you can't see the little dress I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
made for this evening, white and red, with
cords and pink bows."</p>

<p>Then the crack of the door opened and Envy
pushed himself in softly, invisibly. It grew
markedly colder in the room. The mother's
face became gloomy, the feverish girl more restless.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, impatiently, "always sewing,
always sewing. Why do the others, who
were poor, drive about in fine carriages, and
wear soft clothes and laugh so merrily! If they
are wicked, well, then it must be nice to be
wicked. What does my labor bring me?&mdash;hunger
and pain!"</p>

<p>The mother did not hear her daughter's rapid
words, for the child in her arms was wrestling
with death. Outside the wind howled. The
two other children had fallen asleep in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
corner, hungry and exhausted, and in their
dreams Envy had no more power over them,
and they only saw the beautiful Christmas tree
shimmering. It was a long night in which the
lamp of life flickered up and down in that
little house, and a young soul fought at the
hand of Sorrow the fight for life and
death.</p>

<p>Towards morning the wrestling of both was
ended. The child lay dead in its mother's lap,
the young girl slumbered restlessly. The storm
was over. The glittering snow lay piled up
high, looking blue in the shadows of the houses,
and softly tinted with red where the rising sun
met it. Then the bells began to peal for merry
Christmas. That woke the two children, who
stared aghast at the little corpse. The young
girl raised herself, and saw that her mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
wept, but from her eyes there came no tears&mdash;she
envied the dead child its rest.</p>

<p>A merry sound of sledge bells sounded, and
like a lovely dream two beautiful young girls
flew past in a sledge, wrapped snugly in rich
furs. Their cheeks and eyes sparkled with joy
in the beautiful sunshine. It passed like lightning,
this vision, but all in the little house were
dazzled by it. The sick girl drew her thin
hands through her black hair, the poor woman
bit her teeth together, and the two children
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, were those angels?"</p>

<p>"No," she uttered harshly; "they were
human beings like ourselves, only rich and happy,
who are not hungry, and have warm
clothes."</p>

<p>Sorrow touched her arm&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you desire it, I will bring them here, into
your home; but at one price&mdash;they will suffer
pain and misery, and their joy will vanish. Do
you want that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the woman, "I do. Why should
not they watch and weep as we do?"</p>

<p>Sorrow sighed.</p>

<p>"Shall I fetch them?" she asked once again.</p>

<p>"Go, go; do you not see that my children
starve? What do other people's children concern
me?"</p>

<p>Sorrow neared the young girl's bed.</p>

<p>"Farewell for the present," she said; "be
brave and reasonable, and take care of yourself,
that I may not have to come to you again to
punish."</p>

<p>She kissed the children. "I send you the
angels and a good Christmas, have patience."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she softly lifted the door latch and was
gone. Envy slid after her; and in her place,
on the first sunbeam that smote the rows of
houses, Hope floated into the room and made
it light. Mother and children looked out expectantly.
The girl pushed back her hair from
her brow, and the bad thoughts retreated.</p>

<p>Sorrow paced so lightly across the snow that
she scarcely left a trace, as though she were
borne by the sharp east wind, whose pungent
tongue mocked the fine winter morning. She
went through the most aristocratic streets, and
vanished into one of the stateliest houses; entering
so softly that no one noticed her, not even
the servants, who were stretching themselves
on red cushioned divans in the entrance hall;
not even the parrot that always cried, "Canaille!
Canaille!" and made a wise face. She went up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the broad stairs, where everything was perfumed
of fir-trees, straight towards a high door, whence
the laughter of youthful voices resounded. Unnoticed
she stood in the high large room
through whose many windows the sun streamed,
touching the white-covered, long tables, on
which still lay all the presents given the night
before. At one end of the room stood three
tall fir-trees, their branches bent under a gay
weight, and round about the room some thirty
smaller ones. The six huge chandeliers were
encircled with garlands of fir and chains of glass
balls, and from one to the other hung rows of
colored paper lamps. It must have looked
quite fairy-like in the evening with all the candles
alight. Amidst this glory two tall slim,
supple figures, in dark, close-fitting, cloth
dresses, were playing battledore and shuttlecock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Every movement was of rare grace, and the delicate
profiles with the dark arched eyebrows,
stood out well against the somber firs. The
gold brown hair of the one hung in voluptuous
waves over her shoulders, only held together by
a ribbon; a weight of fair plaits hung down the
neck of the other. Their heads thrown backwards
revealed faultlessly set necks and laughing
rows of pearly teeth. It was a sight for
gods, and the young man who looked on
thought so, as he sat in Olympian calm carelessly
reading in an armchair, dressed in an
elegant morning suit, a cigarette in his ring-covered
hand. From time to time, in a powerful
baritone, he hummed some rather frivolous
songs that each time drew down on him a storm
of laughing reproaches.</p>

<p>"I beg my stern cousins to remark," he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
"that the ball has now fallen fourteen times to
the ground, and that I consequently regret that
my proposal was negatived that each such miss
should be punished with a kiss."</p>

<p>The girls laughed, but suddenly they noticed
Sorrow, who looked on seriously at their merriment,
like a distant hail-cloud at a harvest
home.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" both girls asked at once,
approaching their strange guest.</p>

<p>Sorrow would fain have cast down her eyes
that she might not look at the three young
heads in that room; but she saw them, and felt
herself spell-bound. She looked at all three,
and then said in her soft, deep tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have just come from a house where since
yesterday no one has eaten, where this night a
child has died, and a girl lies sick in bed; two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
other children I found out in the snowstorm as
they were admiring a Christmas tree. Can you
not help?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, at once," cried the one with the gold
brown locks. "Albert, be so good as to order
the sledge. Cara, do you run to mother and
ask her for money. I will get food and
clothes."</p>

<p>With all imaginable speed every thing was
got ready. After a brief half-hour the sledge
stood before the door laden with wood and
baskets, and one of the Christmas trees. There
was barely room for the three young people to
squeeze in. The mother, a stately, elegant
woman, with wise eyes, restrained the eldest girl,
Doris, for a second, to say something to her very
earnestly, upon which she kissed both her
hands. Then she, too, flew downstairs after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
others, and as fast as the wind they trotted to
the house of the poor people.</p>

<p>"Mother, the angels have come," cried the
children.</p>

<p>They got out and brought in the tree. Cara
knelt down by the hearth and made a fire, and
Doris placed the tree by the bedside of the sufferer,
darkened the room and lighted it. She
gave the children bread and cake, and then the
two lovely girls stood by the sick girl's bedside
and sang a Christmas carol. The little boy, with
folded hands, looked now at the lights, now at
the angels, and large tears rolled over his pale
face. Albert did not quite know what to do
with himself; but now that the two girls helped
the mother to warm some soup and cut up meat
for the children, he neared the bed, and looked
with scrutiny into the black eyes that glowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and reflected with uncanny fire the lights of the
Christmas tree.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked kindly with
his pleasant voice.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him long and earnestly; she
felt the gaze of his beautiful blue eyes burn into
her heart. Then she grew red, cast down her
eyes, and said: "Lotty."</p>

<p>Soon an animated conversation sprang up
between the two. Albert took out his pocket-book,
wrote a few lines, and sent off the servant
with orders to bring the doctor back in the
sledge. They would wait till he came. Doris's
eyes rested for an instant on her cousin, who had
seated himself on the edge of the bed and talked
eagerly to Lotty. Scarcely was the sledge gone
than she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, that will do for to-day; I will walk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
home. We will come again in a few days, till
then you have provision."</p>

<p>And so speaking she walked out of the house,
regardless of her cousin's remonstrances.</p>

<p>Next day all looked bright and cheerful in
the little room, but grief and pain had entered
the palace. Cara had fallen on the ice while
skating, and lay in bed maimed in all her limbs,
and suffering keenly. Her snow-white hands
lay quiescent beside her plaits upon the coverlet.
Her father patted them, and the tears ran down
his cheeks. Then Cara smiled, but her eyes
looked out dim and deep from their hollows, and
round her lips there quivered a suppressed sigh.
Wearily she dragged on her life for weeks and
weeks; but if any one asked Cara how she was,
she would always answer kindly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think I am much better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>But pain had pinched her face and emaciated
her body, and her hands and feet remained
paralyzed. Her only recreation were Albert's
visits. He told her all manner of things, and
sang her merry songs. Doris grew pale and thin
with continued nursing, so that at last her
mother had to force her to go out. She bethought
her of Lotty, and went to call on her.
How amazed was she to find the little house
transformed, and Lotty changed more than all!
Graceful, rounded in all her limbs, she stepped
towards her, and the slight limp that remained
from her illness only gave her an added grace.
Her eyes had learned to laugh, and her whole
being had gained something attractive and
bright.</p>

<p>"But, Lotty, how well you look! I was afraid
you would think we had forgotten you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"How could I think that," said Lotty, "when
your brother always came to see us!"</p>

<p>"He is not my brother," Doris said shortly,
and grew scarlet.</p>

<p>Then ensued an awkward silence, interrupted
by Doris, who asked to see the children's school-books,
which, superintended by Lotty, bore
inspection well. They had gained good instruction
in the time that had passed.</p>

<p>A few days after Albert went away on a
journey. It was a hard parting for the two girls.
At the last he kissed Doris's hand, and looked at
her earnestly, deep down into her eyes. They
filled with large tears. She wanted to say
something more, but could not bring forth
a sound.</p>

<p>"I shall come back in the summer," he said,
and was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Lotty was soon so well that she could walk
and call on Cara, who was so pleased to see her
that she did not want to let her go. So she was
engaged as companion and nurse for Cara, and
soon grew indispensable to her.</p>

<p>In the spring the family moved to their castle
in the country, where the poor invalid could
lie all day under tall trees. Albert soon came
there too, and Doris took long rides with him
through the park, or they sat for hours chatting
with Cara. Yet he always found time and
opportunity to see Lotty alone. At first she
was distant with him, but with his heart-winning
ways he soon recovered the empire he had had in
the little house in the town; and she was happy
when he said that the parents insisted on marrying
Doris to him, but that he did not think of
it for she did not please him at all. Cara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
noticed that there was something amiss with her
Lotty, but she never dreamed what a fight the
girl was fighting with her heart, that impetuously
demanded love and happiness, and her conscience
that recalled to her her duties and strove
to calm her.</p>

<p>Doris guessed nothing. She was entirely absorbed
in the joy of having her adored Albert
beside her.</p>

<p>Albert really loved Lotty, but he did not want
to lose the rich marriage with Doris; so he was
full of little delicate attentions to her, which in
quiet hours were counted up and talked over
with Cara. Lotty knew herself to be beloved,
therefore her jealousy of Doris knew no bounds.
Every kind look, every unconscious little joke of
Doris's was gall and wormwood to her. She had
to help Doris adorn herself, and see how she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
looked into the glass with beaming eyes, certain
of victory, full of hope. She had to suffer that
her adored Cara did all to make her sister appear
in the best light to Albert. Many an evening in
the park there ensued angry scenes in which
Lotty broke forth into wild reproaches, and
Albert made passionate love protestations.
Lotty was proud; she would be his wife, and at
last he promised her that he would marry her
as soon as he had found a post that insured
enough for them both. He was soon to go
abroad to join an embassy.</p>

<p>Lotty demanded that he should say openly
at the house that he meant to marry her, but
this she could not attain.</p>

<p>Once more Lotty thought&mdash;</p>

<p>"If only I were rich, like the others."</p>

<p>Many a long night she tossed about her black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
locks on the pillow, and next day her eyes
glowed like coals, so that Albert grew almost
afraid, and feared she might make things uncomfortable
for him. He hurried forward his
parting preparations. On the last evening he
was in the park with Doris, and began to speak
to her of his future, and that he should come
back a made man. Then he would woo her,
and he hoped he should not be refused. At the
last he put a bracelet round her wrist, encircled
her with his arm and pressed a kiss on her lips.
Doris flushed all over, ran off to Cara, fell on
her knees beside the bed, kissed her hands, her
hair, her eyes, and was so wildly happy that
it grew almost too much for the poor invalid.
When Albert wanted to leave the park Lotty
stood before him and looked at him so sphinx-like
that he grew afraid. He hoped she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
heard nothing, and took a step forward. But
she struck him in the face with her fist. Then
she vanished. She ran as fast as she could into
her room, and raved all night long, bit her
pillow, and thought to die of rage and despair.</p>

<p>Albert, who slept little, could not see Lotty
again and extort from her a promise of silence.
Twice he knocked at her door, but she kept quiet
till he had gone and then she muttered curses
after him. Next morning he departed without
having seen her. Doris waved her hand after
him long, long after he was out of sight, and
wept blissful tears. But Cara was alarmed when
she saw Lotty. A complete alteration had
come to her face; it was as though something
had snapped. She had to endure hearing Albert
talked of incessantly. Towards Doris she felt a
veritable hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>At first there came letters from Albert, but
they grew rarer and briefer. After a year there
came none. Doris had been radiantly happy
some time and developed to rare beauty. At her
side Hope stood shimmering, rosy, like peach
blossoms. By Cara's bed sat Mother Patience,
invisible to all, and transfigured the pale face
with her calm presence. Beside Lotty strode
Envy and Hate, and tugged at her with all their
might night and day. In the second year Hope
vanished from beside Doris; in the third, the
girl crept wearily through the house as though
each step were leaden. Lotty revived; yes,
Doris even noted that when Lotty combed her
hair she could see in the glass how her black
eyes sparkled maliciously, and seemed to search
her weary face. Doris's parents grew old and
gray during these years of waiting. Albert's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
name was never breathed, it was as though he
was blotted out of all their memories, and yet
all thought only of him.</p>

<p>One morning Doris was sitting at breakfast
with her parents. Cara was still in bed, she was
never carried down till later in the day. The
father read out of his paper, his wife rested her
chin on her slender fingers. Countless fine
lines had become graven into her face, Care was
her daily guest; yet she looked kindly from under
her gray hairs and her elegant cap. Secretly
her glance sought the face of her daughter, who
had leaned back wearily in her chair, toying
with a flower and gazing out vacantly into
space.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would look out of the window,
and watch with heavy eyelids the falling of the
faded autumn leaves, which sank to earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in the thick mist. A fire burnt in the chimney;
it was the only lively thing in the room. Then
a letter was brought in and given to Doris's
father. He twirled it between his fingers and
looked at the address and seal. Doris had
glanced up indifferently. Suddenly every muscle
of her face trembled, and she rested large,
flashing eyes upon her father, her nostrils quivered,
and her breath came short and fast.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, read, read quickly!"</p>

<p>He read long, long, without speaking one
word. At last he folded up the letter. Doris's
torture was at an end, she was near to faint.</p>

<p>"Albert is coming," he said gravely, and
would have gone on speaking, but from Doris's
breast there came a cry of mingled joy and sobbing.
She sprang up, embraced her mother and
rushed out of the room and up the stairs to Cara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cara, he is coming, is coming," she cried,
and covered her sister with kisses.</p>

<p>Lotty rushed to the bedside; it was as though
a fallen angel looked at the happy girl. At
last harshly and roughly she muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who knows what he has become."</p>

<p>Doris felt the poisoned dart, but before she
could answer her mother called her down. As
she entered the room she saw her father pacing
up and down restlessly. He did not notice her.
Her mother sat in a little armchair beside the
fire, staring into the embers. Doris noticed
every thing at a glance. It was as though something
heavy and cold fell upon her heart.</p>

<p>"Come here, dear child," said her mother;
"kneel down here, I have something to say to
you. You have always trusted us, have you not,
my child? You always believed that we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
felt your sufferings too, and have felt them the
more that we could not help you?"</p>

<p>Doris could not speak, she kissed her mother's
hand and looked at her again with large, glowing
eyes.</p>

<p>"If, then, I tell you that Albert is not worthy
of you, my child will believe it, will she not?
He has not kept good; it is said he has gambled
away his fortune, and we should not like
him to ask the hand of our daughter merely in
order to pay his debts. I know you will be
proud and meet him as it becomes your maidenly
dignity. You will let him see nothing of
your soul's combat and woe, but meet him as
he deserves."</p>

<p>"When will he come?" said Doris, curtly.
Her voice was hard.</p>

<p>"In a few days; we cannot forbid him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
house for his mother's sake. I count on you,
my child."</p>

<p>Doris's eyes flashed. She raised herself and
stood her full height; she seemed to have
grown, and looked defiant, ready for fight.
Without a word she went outside into the mist.
She paced the park for hours, heedless of the
paths and ways; she painted to her mind that
meeting, how cold and proud she would be.
She snapped off the twigs as she passed, and
crunched them with her white teeth. It seemed
to her as though she never could go home,
as though she must thus rove the wood
for ever. When she came back to the house
at last, her hair, dress, and eyebrows were
covered with glistening drops. She looked
into the glass that reflected her hard-drawn
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"The wood," she said, "has had pity on me;
those are its tears."</p>

<p>She could not make up her mind to go in to
Cara; she felt as though she could not bear her
affection. Cara wept in her father's arms. He
dried the tears she was shedding for her sister, and
spoke to her tenderly. Lotty clenched her fists.</p>

<p>"She shall not have him as long as I live."</p>

<p>Henceforward Doris went often into the wood,
especially along the path beside the old willow-trees.
The sun still shone warmly there, and
that did good to Doris, who could not get rid
of a feeling of cold. Once she leaned exhausted
against a mighty trunk; she had laid her
hand upon her aching heart, and closed her
eyes. Suddenly she heard a voice close by her,
whose tone made her shrink together as a flower
does in spring rain&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doris."</p>

<p>And there stood Albert, with the same lovely
eyes, the same charm of movement, and yet
how changed. He held out his hand towards
her. She laid her icy fingertips into his; but
when she wanted to draw back her hand he retained
it.</p>

<p>"Am I to be condemned unheard?" he
asked gently, and smiled so sweetly that Doris
could not be as distant and cold as she had resolved.</p>

<p>He did not wait for an answer, but spoke
eagerly and earnestly, accused and defended
himself at the same time, reminded her of their
sweet love that could not possibly be vanished
and fled; ay, he read it in her face that she had
thought of him, while poor Doris, now red, now
pale, could merely look at him. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
turned to go to the house and greet his aunt,
she remained outside, for an awkward friend,
Conscience, told her that she had not been all
that her parents expected.</p>

<p>They did not repeat their injunction, and
the meetings in the park grew more and more
frequent; a correspondence even ensued that
was intrusted to a hollow willow. Doris's
mother noticed a strange, wild look in the girl's
eyes, but she put this down to the struggle her
child was undergoing.</p>

<p>Often Doris would have opened her lips to
confess, but always closed them again. Daily
she grew more irritable, spoke in hollow tones,
and laughed at every thing. Lotty knew exactly
all that went on. She bided her time,
ready to spring like a cat whenever the hour
should be ripe. One day Doris could not get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
out, and so begged Lotty, in a seemingly indifferent
tone, to carry a letter to the tree.
Lotty held the letter between her fingers and
looked now at it, now at Doris.</p>

<p>"Well," said Doris, sharply, but without
looking up, "is it inconvenient to you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lotty, carelessly, went towards
the door, and then came back beside Doris.</p>

<p>"I shall only carry that letter," she said,
"after I have told you what manner of man
your lover is."</p>

<p>Lotty looked so fierce that Doris shuddered.</p>

<p>"He loved me, me, long before he loved you:
me he has kissed many hundred times in this
very park ere ever he gave you the one that
made you so happy; me he promised to wed.
It is me he called his dear heart, his love, all
the soft names he has called you; and on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
evening you were betrothed to him, I hit him
in his face, and now he is so vile that no decent
girl would wish to have him; and you, you
carry on a secret love affair with him."</p>

<p>Doris grew giddy; but before she had taken
in the full sense of these words, Lotty had left
the room and did not re-appear.</p>

<p>The following evening, when Lotty had just
got into bed, Doris stood before her like a
ghost. She shook her arms and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come!"</p>

<p>She followed Doris into her room. The girl
shut and locked the door, and pocketed the key.</p>

<p>"Now tell it me all again," she said, speaking
with effort.</p>

<p>Lotty no longer felt the satisfaction she had
experienced that first moment. She was
ashamed of her weakness, and told her tale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
with hesitation and with reserve. While she
did so she had ever to look at Doris, who grew
momentarily more haggard, and who bent herself
twice, thrice; whether in physical or mental
pain Lotty did not know. Suppressing a
low moan, she drew a small roll of paper from
her pocket, and smiled with trembling lips.</p>

<p>"You have avenged yourself on me; now is
your turn with him; you owe me this, for you
should have spared me this agony. To-morrow
morning you go to town and give him this; you
yourself must give it to him; I demand it."</p>

<p>Scarcely had Doris uttered these words than
she began to moan piteously, and now followed
a night during which Lotty was terrified by the
sufferings of her young mistress. Constantly
she tried to get the key and call the family;
Doris would not let her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," she said; "we two must pass this night
alone together."</p>

<p>Only when consciousness began to leave her,
Lotty succeeded in wrenching the key from her
clenched hands. She called up the parents,
who arrived but in time to receive their daughter's
last breath. She opened her eyes once
again, knew her mother, kissed each of her fingertips
and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Farewell, mother; farewell, forgive me."</p>

<p>Then a last terrible spasm shook her, and
when the sun rose she was a corpse. While
the parents were with Cara, trying to break the
news gently to the poor invalid, Lotty slipped
away into her own room. There she unrolled
the paper and read&mdash;</p>

<p>"Could I have believed in you, I should
have lived.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Doris.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she set out for the town and sought
out Albert, who was still in bed sleeping restlessly.
Lotty looked at him long and severely.
Her gaze was so savage that a feeling of fear
shot through him and woke him. He started
up.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he cried aghast.</p>

<p>Lotty handed him the paper without speaking
a word, and before he had unfolded it she had
gone.</p>

<p>He threw on his clothes and hurried after
her, but he could not find her. He ran about
all day: he hovered round the castle, he chased
through the park. He looked as though the
Furies pursued him. At last he went home,
sat down to his desk, and began to turn over a
pile of dirty papers. Great drops stood on his
brow. In the evening he went to see a friend,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and gambled the whole night. In a short time
he had won large sums, but then a few days
after he lost them all again, those and much
more besides. One morning he tottered into
his room, loaded a pistol and shot himself.</p>

<p>Lotty got home unnoticed as she had gone
out; but as she entered Sorrow stood in front
of her, and her eyes were so terrible that Lotty
fell down before her on the earth and covered
her face with her hands. But when Sorrow
began to speak, Lotty was seized with trembling
at the stern words that fell upon her like
hammer blows; she writhed on the ground like
a worm, but Sorrow was inexorable.</p>

<p>"You have done your work well," she said;
"you have avenged yourself. But on whom?
On those who have done you kindness from the
first hour when they raised you out of misery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and wretchedness, those to whom you owe all&mdash;your
life, your health&mdash;who have treated you
as a child and a sister. They were happy before
I brought them to your house, and what
are they now? I know you want to throw
yourself into the water, but I will not suffer it,
for you need a whole long life to make good
the thoughts that have poisoned your youth.
You must give up your whole strength to poor
Cara, beside whose bed you will yet often see
me, and take care that you need not tremble
before my face, as you must to-day. Cara
needs you, for her parents are broken down,
and only through boundless self-sacrifice may
you dare to hope for forgiveness. As yet I
cannot accord it."</p>

<p>Once more it was Christmas Eve. A beautiful
tree was alight in the little house. Lotty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
had brought it there in Cara's name. The
children had red cheeks and shouted joyously.
The mother too had grown to look younger
and smiled often. Only Lotty was pale as
death and dark as remorse.</p>

<p>"Here my mother looks at me," she thought;
"and thinks Lotty has grown bad; and there
Doris's mother looks at me and thinks, 'Had
you but called me we could have saved the
child.' Oh that I had starved to death!"</p>

<p>In the castle a shaded lamp burnt beside
Cara's bed. Her father was reading to her with
weary voice, the mother sat by, stroked the
girl's hands, and dried the heavy, slow-falling
tears that rolled down her child's face with a
soft handkerchief. Cara had not spoken all the
evening. Only once she asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is not this Christmas Eve?"</p>

<span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> waters tossed and foamed through
the huge rocks that were pressed so
close together that up amid the
heights a strip of blue sky was scarcely to be
seen. Upon a narrow slippery path, alongside
the oozy rocky walls, ran Sorrow, as fast as
though the path were sure and the surroundings
a flowery meadow. The rushing waters threatened
every moment to ingulf her. Their
thunder, repeated by a thousand echoes, seemed
to grow yet louder, and sounded so menacing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
as though the audacious pilgrim must turn back
before them. But with burning cheeks Sorrow
hurried onwards, and her long black hair floated
behind her like a somber cloud. Her nostrils
quivered, her lips opened and shut, with outstretched
arms she whispered or called something,
but the sound died away before it was
spoken. Her eyes stared into space as though
she would search the depths, and yet they had
fain be cast down, for the gorge narrowed and
the last trace of a path was inundated by the
water. Beneath her surged a whirlpool, above
her rushed the water, rushed down in ever new
masses; now it sounded like song, now like
moaning voices, now like pealing thunder. One
moment she halted, then she raised her thin
skirts and began to wade through the water
where the rocks had quieted it a little and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
scooped out a place large enough for her small
feet. With one hand she held herself against
the rocky wall and looked from time to time
into the depths where yawned the opening of a
cavern. At the risk of death she reached the
entrance and stood still a second, breathing
deeply. Once more her gaze eagerly swept the
sides of the cliffs; there was no projection on
which to gain a footing, no bird could have
stood there. Out of the cavern's mouth there
gushed water, and it too offered no road. One
more look did she cast back, then she resolutely
entered the cave and groped through it in the
dark, along the wet stones. Often she sank
deep into the waters. When she lost sight of
the last sheen of daylight she resolved to wade,
and did not feel in the icy cold of the water
how the stones cut her feet. At last a red spot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
gleamed. She thought it was the daylight outside
the cavern. Then the space enlarged. In
this impenetrable darkness there was a huge
vault adorned with columns and capitals and
ornaments of all kinds. Darting lights and
shades quivered through the hall, which re-echoed
with the sound of weeping and moaning.
It was a confusion of sobbing women, whimpering
children, groaning, sighing men, and every
flash of light seemed to increase the misery.
Sorrow pressed her hands upon her breast and
panted. She was so dazzled that at first she
could not see whence these lightnings came;
the horrible sounds about her made her giddy.
She leaned against one of the shining columns
and shading her eyes with her hand, sought to
follow the water-course and so discover the exit.
There she beheld a colossal man, as tall, rough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and angular as the columns around. His ardent
eyes were fixed on her. In his hand he held
the lightnings, which from time to time he
threw across the cave like fiery arrows or blue
snakes.</p>

<p>"Come here, little Sorrow," he called in a
voice of thunder. "Have you found your way
to me? Come here, for you are mine."</p>

<p>Sorrow clung to the pillar against which she
leaned and seized one of its pendent points.
Pale as death, she glared at the monster who
beckoned to her.</p>

<p>"I will not come to you," she said at last. "I
do not know you. I seek for Peace whom I saw
go in here, and I am hurrying after him. Oh,"
she cried, and wrung her hands; "oh, have you
hidden him here, or perchance killed him, you
terrible man?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am Pain. Peace is not here, but beyond
this cave, in the happy valley."</p>

<p>"Show me the exit that I may follow him;"
and Sorrow sank down on her knees imploringly.</p>

<p>The fearful man laughed, and his laughter
was louder than the rushing and thundering of
the waters, more terrible than the sound of
moaning round about.</p>

<p>"No, child; you and I, we do not belong to
the happy valley, and the exit thither is barred
to us by the weepers who fill this cave, and who
are our victims. We two belong together.
You shall be my wife, and we will seek a spot
to fix our dwelling."</p>

<p>"Your wife!"</p>

<p>The words came from Sorrow's breast like
a cry, but they were drowned in laughter.
Then she darted up and turned to fly. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
her arm was seized in such a grip that she
thought it would break, and Pain swung his
lightnings over her head.</p>

<p>"If ever you flee from me," he roared, "one
of these shall fall on you, and what you will
then feel will be so horrible that crushed, burnt,
tortured, you will scarcely be able to moan like
these wretches. I will show them to you."</p>

<p>He lifted the hand that held the lightnings
and illuminated the whole space. No human
words can tell what fearful forms filled it. Of
every age and sex stricken ones lay around.
They wound themselves in agony, they lacerated
themselves with their fists, they clawed the
stones and with the nails of their hands and
feet tried to raise themselves. Horrid wounds
were held under the falling drops to cool them.
Women writhed in eternal birth-throes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
could not bring forth; children beat their heads
sore against the rocky walls to overpower the
pain that gnawed their entrails. Many lay on
their knees and wrung their hands and beat
their breasts in unextinguishable remorse.
Others lay motionless, as though dead, only
their eyes moved slowly in their sockets, following
the direction of the light. Sorrow veiled
her face and tottered; Pain caught her in his
arms and pressed her to his breast.</p>

<p>"As great as are these agonies, so great is
my love," he said.</p>

<p>Sorrow wept passionately.</p>

<p>"How could you think Peace could be yours.
You have nothing in common with him. You
are mine; you belong to me. I have loved you
in your deeds without beholding you; your
traces delighted my eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew her hands away from her face and
kissed her. Sorrow closed her eyes that she
might not see him, but under her dark lids tears
welled forth, which he kissed away.</p>

<p>"Weep, weep, my little maid; your tears are
dew, far fairer than your laughter, they refresh
and cheer me."</p>

<p>She tried to get loose from him, but he held
her with his iron grasp.</p>

<p>"If you are afraid here," he said, "I will bear
you to a sweet spot and win you there with
violence."</p>

<p>He hastily raised the trembling maiden in
his arms, threw a lightning in front of him that
traced a line of light along the whole dark
passage, and wading through the waters that
seemed to retreat from his feet, he hurried to
the cavern's mouth. He bore her past the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
waterfall, and when he let her glide to earth, he
took hold of her hand, as though he feared she
would escape him. She often looked back and
tried to think of the happy valley, but to her
mental vision there ever appeared only the cave
with its desperate inhabitants. She hoped the
terrible man might grow weary, and then if sleep
overcame him, she could flee; therefore she
complained of fatigue. But Pain was never
weary; he instantly carried her again, and
went onwards yet faster.</p>

<p>"Be happy," he said, "for now at least some
one carries you."</p>

<p>She turned her head away from his gleaming
eyes. Then a great sense of weakness came over
her, and it seemed to her as though they were
going backwards, as though the rushing of the
river came ever nearer, as though his eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
pierced her breast. Powerless to speak or move,
she lay in the arms of Pain. Oh, where&mdash;where
was her brother Death, who could have freed
her? Where her father Strife? He would
have wrestled with her captor. Or was he too
powerless against this all-mighty Pain? She
would have prayed the river, the trees, the
grasses to help her, but they did not see her
need. At last she lost consciousness, and when
she woke she lay under a rock amid deep hot
sand&mdash;no tree, no song of bird, no murmur of
waters; only sand, yellow burning sand and
golden air that quivered in the heat.</p>

<p>"My wife," said Pain, and his eyes burnt like
the sand and the air, and seemed to drain
Sorrow's life blood. Her tears began to flow
anew.</p>

<p>"Oh! how thirsty I am," she moaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Pain looked at her with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "was it not beautiful in that
cool gorge, so near to the cold foaming river?
Do you recall how clear it was, and how it
gushed out of the rocks? It came from the
happy valley, that is so full of luscious fruits,
fruits such as you have never beheld. Shall I
show it you?"</p>

<p>At his words Sorrow's eyes had grown ever
bigger, her lips more parched.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she panted, and behold, away,
across the sand, there shimmered in the air a
broad stream, and beside it were shady trees
laden with fruits. Without knowing what she
did, Sorrow sprang up and ran to the river as
fast as she could, through the deep sand, under
the scorching sunbeams. But the river seemed
to retreat ever further from her, and at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201</a></span>
it had vanished. At the same moment Pain
laughed behind her, and it sounded as though
the whole desert laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you now see that you are wholly in my
power; you can even only think as I will.
Here is water."</p>

<p>He showed her a few trees that overshadowed
a well. Sorrow fell down beside it and drank
eager draughts. Then she sank into a deep sleep.
When she woke the trees were withered, the well
dried up, and there was again nothing but sand
as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>"Do you see," said Pain, "we are stronger
than the sun and the desert wind; all must
vanish before our might. Wherever we have
passed pestilence has broken out, towns and
villages are burnt; and where we set up our
dwelling the earth grows a desert."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Sorrow wrung her hands. She sprang up
and hurried forward. A whole long day she
sped on, on, and did not see that he followed.
At evening he came towards her and laughed,
and laughed so long that the whole desert grew
noisy, and hyenas and jackals began to howl,
and lions approached roaring. But Pain held
them in check with his look of fire, so that they
only walked round them from afar off all the
night. When day dawned the wild beasts
withdrew.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sorrow, "I die of fear. Take me
away from here, wherever you will, only away
from this heat, these horrid beasts."</p>

<p>"Do you want coolness, love? You shall
have it."</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and bore her fast
as the wind towards the north, ever further,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
past the homes of men, past fields and cities,
across the ocean, which he waded through, up
to the North. There lay a lovely islet, and
birches shook their tender foliage in the fresh
breezes.</p>

<p>"Here we will found our happy valley," said
Pain, and beckoned.</p>

<p>And as he beckoned the wind blew colder
and sharper, the grass crackled under his feet
as it withered and froze, and from the ocean
there neared crystal mountains that came closer
and closer to the land, and the wind that drove
them to shore howled dismally. Soon the
whole air was filled with snow that whirled
from above, from below, from all sides, choking
like fine sand. Ice-blocks were piled upon ice-blocks,
there was much thundering and crackling,
but at last all was still, wrapped in snow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and awful silence. The transparent rocks
stared up to the heavens like frozen joy. Pain
flung a lightning dart into the ice. It bored a
blue-green glistening cave in which he laid
Sorrow.</p>

<p>"Do you stay here and rest," he said; "I
will search for a verdant spot. But do not stir
from here, for out of the ice-fields you will
never find your road back to the happy
valley."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he gone than Sorrow felt her
frozen blood revive, and the terrible woe in her
breast seemed to yield. First she leaned on
her hand and peeped out, then she knelt and
breathed on her numbed fingers, then she
stepped outside. There towered blocks of ice;
here snow was spread in endless extent. She
knew that the snow covered the island and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
ice-blocks the sea, and it was over the ice-blocks
she must wander, for otherwise she
could not get across it. She began to slip
through the cracks and crevices, to jump from
one block to another, following the sunbeams
that alone marked a track for her. She did
not rest when night came for fear she should be
pursued. Twice she went round the island
without knowing it, in her senseless fear; but
at last the sun led her out of the ice-bound
world and across the first green blades of grass.
Then she sank down for very weariness. How
she found her road back to the mountain gorge
she never knew. She entered it trembling. If
he was already here, he from whom she had
fled, then she was lost. After her wanderings
upon the ice, this road seemed to be quite easy,
and her fearful glances around were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
directed to the masses of water that poured
down yet more wildly than when she had first
come here, and which seemed to threaten her
tender form at every moment, as though they
would sweep her away like a leaf. Trembling
in every limb, and with chattering teeth,
Sorrow entered the dreadful cave.</p>

<p>It was dark, and the confusion of voices
sounded painfully through the vaults. Suddenly
she felt herself surrounded on all sides,
and held by her hands and clothes.</p>

<p>"I will not let you go before you liberate
me," a voice sounded at her ear.</p>

<p>"Give me back happiness," moaned another.</p>

<p>"Make me well again," cried a third.</p>

<p>"We are but echoes of the woes of earth,"
they cried; "but you shall hear us, though
you stay here forever."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I cannot help you," wailed Sorrow.</p>

<p>"Yes," they shrieked; "you can bring woe,
but you will not free us. Revenge! revenge!"</p>

<p>And Sorrow felt herself pressed against the
angular columns, and in the noise that clamored
round her, she heard&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bind her, bind her, tear out her heart.
Blind the eyes of her who has brought so much
woe."</p>

<p>In her fear she cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beware what you do, Pain comes behind
me, and terrible will be his revenge if you hurt
a hair of my head."</p>

<p>Then she forced a road for herself and ran on,
on to the spot where she fancied was the outlet
She groped a long while along the dripping
walls, but just as she had found it, she
felt herself held anew, and a voice said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what will Pain do to you if you flee
thither? Kiss me, or I will betray you."</p>

<p>"Do not kiss him, his face is quite mutilated,"
called another voice.</p>

<p>"I will betray you," was whispered into her
ear. "I will hold you fast until Pain comes.
Kiss me."</p>

<p>Sorrow bent down trembling, and touched a
hideous mass with her delicate lips; then she
freed herself shuddering, and fled on again along
the dark passage. She had to bend nearly
double, it grew so low. She dipped her hand
in the water and washed her face. It seemed to
her as if she never advanced, as if she would
never reach the end. At last there shone a
bright spot that slowly grew larger. There, yes,
there, gleamed the dear sun; there must be the
happy valley. But how, if Peace, whom she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
had sought in vain over the whole earth, were
there no longer! But if he were not, she could
at least follow in his footsteps, and rest there
where he had passed.</p>

<p>Now the outlet of the cave yawned, and
Sorrow stood still dazzled. Whatever there
was that was fair on earth, whatever could be
pictured of power and beauty, was all collected
in that valley&mdash;luscious greenery, wealth of
flowers that covered the earth or crept along
the giant trees in lovely garlands, trees that no
ax had ever touched, and a singing of birds
like heavenly music. A deep green lake reflected
all this beauty; deer and gazelles stood
around it and drank.</p>

<p>At Sorrow's feet shone strawberries in rich red
masses, above her head hovered a bird of paradise,
the tip of his golden tail touched her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Sorrow heard a voice, at whose
tones it seemed to her as though her heart leapt
from her mouth. At first it sounded so soft, so
full and gentle, like purest melody; then it
seemed to retreat. Sorrow held her breath.
Now again it came nearer, and at last she could
hear the words.</p>

<p>"You are the only maid on earth whom I can
love, and you will not stay with me! Is it not
fair enough here to please you?"</p>

<p>To whom were these words spoken, for whom
the caressing sound of that voice? Sorrow bent
back a branch and beheld Peace with his
heavenly eyes, calm like a deep lake, and his
radiant face of blooming youth. Sorrow was so
sunk in contemplation that she forgot herself,
her existence, and the sufferings she had endured.
Her soul was in her eyes and quaffed eagerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
this first refreshment. Then another face
came to view. Sorrow at once recognized Work
by her bright blue eyes and the waving of her
golden locks. She was blushing and tending
her sweet lips to Peace. How lovely they both
were under the green half shadows of the broad
leaves! Sorrow held her breath, the branch
trembled in her hand.</p>

<p>"Do not go back to earth," Peace pleaded;
"you know what that is like."</p>

<p>"I must, I must," said Work. "I am the
comforter in all need, I have dried the tears of
even Sorrow herself."</p>

<p>"Oh do not speak of Sorrow here."</p>

<p>"Have you ever beheld her?"</p>

<p>"I have beheld her!" and Peace's eyes grew
veiled; "and she destroyed my heaven with her
ugly eyes. I have fled from her across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
whole world and hidden here from her sight, for
through that awful cave she will not come.
Her victims will not let her pass, if ever she
sets foot in it."</p>

<p>At that instant the poor listener felt herself
seized in an iron grasp, and the cry that would
have issued from her was stifled by a strong
hand. She reeled back through the dark passage,
into the cavern in which lightning flamed.
Now she was forcibly bound and before her
stood Pain in towering passion.</p>

<p>"What shall I do to you, faithless one?" he
gnashed.</p>

<p>"Revenge, revenge!" resounded from all
sides, and a rain of stones hit the defenseless
one.</p>

<p>Sorrow sank on her knees, but Pain raised
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he said, "she is not to be given over
to you, for she must return to earth; but I will
return her to earth in such a manner that she
shall with unconcern do yet more mischief than
heretofore."</p>

<p>He seized Sorrow by her hair and drew her
forth relentlessly, away from the howls of the
cave which pursued her long.</p>

<p>It was twilight outside; under the rocks it
was already night. Sorrow was dragged onwards,
she knew not how, she knew not whither.
Now she flew up the mountain sides, ever
higher, higher, dragged, when her tottering
knees would no longer bear her, across bare
stones and through thorn-bushes. A fearful
storm raged. At last she reached a high mountain
top on which there was only room for her
foot. Here she stood a second above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
dark-threatening mountain forest lashed by
the wind, high and free, above the mountains
and the clefts, above the firs and the waters,
alone in the world. She no longer felt, she did
not see Pain who cowered near to her on a
rocky ledge and waited. Now he raised his
hand and cast lightning upon lightning towards
her. From her crown to her feet she felt herself
torn and penetrated by these glowing rays.</p>

<p>She silently extended her arms and turned
round slowly. As she did so, the last lightning
dart pierced through her eyes into her heart,
and she fell down, down, deep into the yawning
precipice. Pain listened until he heard her fall,
and then laughed terribly. The mountains answered
his laugh with thundrous voice, the firs
bent and broke, the waters stood still a second
for fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>How long Sorrow lay in that abyss none
knew, for none asked after her. The firs alone
kept watch over the sleeper and whispered
dreams to her that she did not hear.</p>

<p>One day strong steps broke the silence, and
Courage, his club upon his shoulder, came
singing by. He beheld Sorrow as she lay there,
her head on a stone, her feet in the water,
encircled with her long black hair that had been
bathed in blood. He raised the body and
rubbed her numb hands.</p>

<p>"Have I got you at last?" he said, "I wanted
to find you. You may not die, you must be
alive again."</p>

<p>He warmed her in his arms, he revived her
with his breath until she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why do you seek me?" she asked in tuneless
voice. "I am dead."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"The world misses you, you must wander
again. Sin reigns unchecked since you have
vanished."</p>

<p>"Let her keep her empire," said Sorrow, and
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Courage shook her.</p>

<p>"It must not be, little sister, you must wander
again."</p>

<p>"But I am dead, do you not see? Do you
not see that I am burnt?&mdash;my brain, my eyes,
my heart; leave me alone."</p>

<p>"That does not concern the world whether
you wander through it dead or alive, but wander
you must. I will not let you go till you do."</p>

<p>He raised her on her feet. She turned and
looked at him. He grew pale. Her face was
stony, her eyes stony, her hair hung round
her rigid and dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217-218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I go?" she said, without moving her
lips.</p>

<p>"Go," said Courage, "for you all pains are
past; you will gaze into the world indifferently,
a fearful enemy to Sin."</p>

<p>Sorrow swept her hair from off her marble
brow, and tried to collect herself. As memory
stirred, her eyes began to flash again; but their
light died down almost immediately. Yes, she
had grown terrible, as terrible as Pain had
desired in his fierce vengeance, as terrible as she
needed to be to put a curb on Sin. Poor little
Sorrow!</p>

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> forest gorge was full of the sound
of trickling and running waters. A
streamlet skipped from rock to rock.
Through the dense foliage a sunbeam crept
here and there, and changed into a rainbow
in the embraces of the waters. Here and
there dark little pools formed, upon whose surface
floated a withered leaf, until it came too
close to the current and vanished, whirling over
the nearest waterfall. Huge tree trunks had
fallen across the gorge. They were used as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
bridges by the mosses and climbing plants that
overgrew them with exuberant vitality, and
hung down from their sides as though they
would drink of the waters that murmured beneath.
There of a sudden a wondrously white
arm stretched forth from out of the climbing
plants. In its delicate hand it held a staff of rock
crystal with a diamond knob, that flashed and
glistened strangely, as though the sun had
stepped down to behold itself in the mountain
stream. Then fair curls came to view over the
confusion of plants that covered the tree trunk;
then a rosy face, with large dreamy eyes, now
black, now dark blue in color, according to the
thoughts that swayed under the cover of its curls.
Anon the charming being knelt, and one could
see the golden girdle that held the soft garment
which clung about her tender form, and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
other hand that held a spindle cut from a single
emerald, which she twirled in the air as though
she would that it outshine the green of the
beech leaves.</p>

<p>"Oh, M&auml;rchen,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]
</a> M&auml;rchen," the brook began
to sing, "will you not bathe to-day? Put by
your staff and spindle and dip down to me. I
have not kissed you to-day."</p>

<p>The fair head peeped down and looked into
the wood. No, there was no one there, not
even a deer. So M&auml;rchen laid distaff and
spindle among the moss of the tree trunk,
twisted her hair into a knot, let fall her linen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
garment, and, seizing hold of two twigs, let
herself glide down to the surface of the brook,
and then began to swing merrily to and fro, her
feet touching the water as she swung. But the
brook did not cease from singing, and from
imploring her to come down into him. Then
she let go the twigs, and fell, like a shower of
spring blossoms, into its wavelets.</p>

<p>Far from here was a lonely gorge. Rock
towered upon rock, and a torrent forced its way
through with difficulty. There a grave man
leaned and looked down into the waterfall. His
brow was thoughtful; the hand that rested upon
the stones was delicate, almost suffering. A
pencil had fallen from its grasp. Suddenly
there sounded a wondrous singing from out
the waterfall, and the man's brow grew clearer
as he listened. That was the moment when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
M&auml;rchen had touched the waters, and it sang
and sounded and was full of lovely forms and
sweet songs and many fair things that attracted
that lonely man. He listened enraptured, and
his soul expanded with the things he heard.
The brook itself hardly knew what it babbled;
it still trembled from having felt M&auml;rchen's
touch, and it sang for sheer joy. The lonely
man departed with lightened brow and airy
steps as though the air bore him. He had
not long gone before M&auml;rchen appeared upon
one of the highest rocks, swung her distaff in
the air, and filled it with gossamer that glistened
in the dew. Then she skipped down, broke a
branch from a blossoming wild rose-bush and
encircled the distaff with it in lieu of a ribbon,
put it into her belt, and, jumping from stone to
stone, crossed the brook and went far into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
forest. The birds flew about her and chirped to
her news of the east and west, the north
and south. Squirrels slid out of the trees,
seated themselves at her feet, looked at her
with their sage eyes, and recounted all that had
happened in the wood. The deer and does
came about her; even the blind worms reared
their heads and chattered with their sharp
tongues. M&auml;rchen stood still and listened; and
from time to time she touched her distaff as
though she would say, "Remember."</p>

<p>The forest grew ever denser, the flowers that
sent out their scent to M&auml;rchen more luxurious.
At last she had to bend the branches apart
in order to penetrate further. There stood a
dream-like castle with tall gabled windows, into
which grew the tree branches, and from out
which tumbled creeping plants. Roof and walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
had vanished beneath the roses that grew over
all things, and out of the castle sounded a thousand
songs of birds. M&auml;rchen stepped to the
open door and entered the wide hall, whose
floor and walls were of jewels, and in whose
midst a tall fountain played. Round about
stood hundreds of Kobolds. They had brought
with them little stools of pure gold, and waited
to see if their sweet queen be content. She
smiled approvingly, and thanked her friends.
In midst of all this shimmering splendor fair
M&auml;rchen stood like a reviving sunbeam.</p>

<p>"See how I have filled my distaff to-day,"
she said, genially. "I believe a magnet lives
in your crystal, to which all things fly. Will
you not fill it yet fuller?"</p>

<p>The Kobolds frowned, which made them look
very comic, and one said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have resolved to tell you nothing more,
because you let it flow from you like the water
that tumbles yonder. We have watched you.
When you go forth at eve, you go to our enemies,
the mortals&mdash;those wretched thieves that
rob our treasures, and you tell them our secrets."</p>

<p>"No," said M&auml;rchen, "I do not go to all
mortals; only to some&mdash;your friends, who love
you as I do; and I only tell them as much as
they deserve. Will you not go on trusting
me?"</p>

<p>They pushed a golden stool near to the fountain
and began to recount to M&auml;rchen, whose
eyes gleamed like the ocean. When she had
heard enough, and given it to the distaff to guard,
she nodded to her little guests, who hurried
away. She then passed into the nearest chamber.
There stood such a wealth of flowers that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
one could not tell where first to rest one's eyes.
The walls were covered with all the wonders of
the tropics; from the ceiling hung orchids; the
floor was overgrown with soft green moss, from
which peeped crocuses, hyacinths, violets, primroses,
and lilies of the valley. Hummingbirds and
nightingales greeted their queen joyously, while
from the flower crowns elves uprose and stretched
out their arms in love.</p>

<p>M&auml;rchen seated herself on the grass and let
them talk to her, toyed with the fair flower-children
and began to sing in unison with the
birds. Then she entered the next room, whose
walls were pure rock crystal, that reflected
M&auml;rchen many hundred times. In its center,
under mighty palm fans, was a large basin,
studded with rubies, into which foamed a waterfall.
The nixes lay around it upon couches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
and waited for the beauty whom as yet they had
not seen that day. But M&auml;rchen wanted to
hear no more; she had, like a true queen, given
ear to so many that she was overpowered with
fatigue, and craved rest. So she passed into
the next room, that was a single little bower of
rushes and bindweeds; the ground was strewn
with poppy flowers, and in its midst stood the
fairest couch eye has seen&mdash;one single, large
rose&mdash;into which M&auml;rchen laid herself, and that
closed its leaves above her.</p>

<p>Now the rushes began to rustle like an echo
of distant singing, and the bindweeds tolled
their bells, and the poppies gave forth their
faint odor, and M&auml;rchen slumbered deep and
sweet until the evening.</p>

<p>When the sun was sinking, and gazed like a
large, glowing eye between the trunks of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
forest, so that all the leaves looked golden,
M&auml;rchen awoke, placed her distaff in her girdle,
put the spindle beside it, and stepped outside.</p>

<p>Twilight was creeping up mysteriously and
dreamily and spreading its wings over the
forest. The birds grew still; only the toads
in the watery gorge began their one-toned song.
A gentle murmur ran through the leaves and
across the parched grass, for all wanted to look
on M&auml;rchen and aspired towards her. Now the
moon rose and threw bright lights hither and
thither and haunted the trees. He wanted to
kiss M&auml;rchen and entice her forth to play upon
the forest meadow.</p>

<p>"The elves await you," he called after M&auml;rchen,
who would not listen, but floated on airily,
as though the evening breezes bore her. A
mill stood beside the brook in the shadow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the beeches. A fire gleamed within it, around
which people sat gathered. M&auml;rchen entered,
and called the children. They flew towards her
and drew her to the fireside, brought her a stool
to sit upon, and gazed with large, eager eyes at
her full distaff.</p>

<p>M&auml;rchen caressed the dear, fair heads, drew
forth the spindle, knotted the yarn, and began
to spin. And while the spindle floated up and
down, swirling, she told them what she beheld
in the yarn, until from sheer listening the children's
eyes fell to, and they never knew next
day whether they had really seen M&auml;rchen or
only in their sleep. She herself slipped out and
glided between the trees till she came to a
meadow shimmering in evening mist. Hundreds
of butterflies hung upon the myriad
flowers, two and three on one blossom, and slept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
so deep and sound that the heads of the sleepy
flowers hung deep down under the weight of
so many guests. Only the large night-moth
floated about darkly and watched over the whole.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the butterflies dream," thought
M&auml;rchen, as she knelt down beside the flowers
and approached her ear.</p>

<p>Yes, they dreamed of the journeys they had
taken that day; they dreamed they had gained
far fairer colors: just such green, blue, and red
hues like the flowers and leaves. Even the
plainest gray one dreamt of colors brighter
than the gayest parrot. The flowers dreamt
that a warm wind touched them, and gave to
them far sweeter scents than they had ever
owned&mdash;quite intoxicatingly luscious. It was
M&auml;rchen's breath which they had felt in their
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon M&auml;rchen came to a pretty house beside
a gurgling stream. The water formed a quiet
little pool, in which the moon and the ivy-grown
house were reflected. The beeches dipped the
tips of their branches into it, and a nightingale
sang lonesomely into the night. Up in the
house burnt a solitary light, like to a glowworm.
M&auml;rchen entered the house as though it were
most familiar to her, opened a door softly, and
stepped within a little room. In a deep armchair,
beside a writing-table, sat a handsome,
pale, agitated man. His head was sunk in his
palm, and he gazed with lightless eyes across
the table, on which Sorrow was resting both
her hands.</p>

<p>"See," he said, "this morning, beside the
mountain stream, I was glad for a moment.
Pictures filled my brain, but now all is empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and dead, and I am so weary&mdash;so weary. I
wish to die. I cannot forgive my body that it
still lives on, and yet a heavenly gift dwells
within me that keeps me alive and makes me
believe I could still create. But I do nothing
more. Fatigue has grown stronger than aught
else in this ugly world. Would that I had
never been born, for I am a man who must reflect
the whole world in its pain and suffering
and falsehood. I love men too much, and therefore
they have no faces for me. I only see their
souls, and these are beautiful notwithstanding
all wickedness and misery. Now I grow miserable
with them. I should like to hide before
my own eyes, for I am worth nothing&mdash;nothing.
All that I do is vain, and will vanish unheard;
all I think others know much better. A fire
burns in me that consumes me in lieu of warming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
my fellow-men. I feel like one that is
drowning, to whom no saving hand is extended.
I should be a man and save myself, but my
strength is at an end. I have lived too much.
I have lived through all that which others have
felt, and borne my own woes besides. Now it
is too much, do you see&mdash;too much; and I can
no longer give to the world what I fain would
have given it&mdash;all the new, great, lovely things
that dwell in my brain. But it had no time to
listen to me. And perhaps there is, after all,
no value in these things, though to my small
mind they seemed so great. Yet they cannot
bear the light. I am weary. I want to die."</p>

<p>Sorrow listened, and never took her eyes from
him; but her pitying gaze made him yet more
irritable and desperate. Suddenly M&auml;rchen
stood before him, with glittering distaff, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
shining teeth and beaming eyes; dimples in her
cheeks, and the distaff of promise in her hands.
He looked at her and was dazzled.</p>

<p>"I wanted to help," said Sorrow, "but he
grew ever worse."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> help him!"</p>

<p>M&auml;rchen laughed.</p>

<p>"Go your ways and leave him to me; I will
manage him. I know all. You are once more
weary of the world and want to die, and have
no talent, and men are all bad, very wicked indeed,
and faithless, and have deserted you, and
do not believe in you. Oh, you poor, poor
human soul! Why do you not become a butterfly
and sleep on a flower? He knows that
he has wings, and that his flower has scent, and
that his meadow is quite full of blossoms.
What does he care whether the others see it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
since he sees it! And now look here; I have
come back, although you scarcely deserve it,
you doubter. Look at this heavy laden distaff,
that is for you, only for you, if you will listen
to me."</p>

<p>And M&auml;rchen began to spin and sing and
narrate all night long, and her friend wrote and
wrote, without knowing that his pencil moved;
he thought he had only heard and listened. He
wrote down thoughts and songs and poems;
they streamed like living fire from under his
hand. And what he wrote moved the world.
Men thought his thoughts after him, and sang
his songs, and wept over his stories, and knew
not that the poet who had given them all these
things was sad unto death, misunderstood of
all, and that Sorrow visited him far oftener than
M&auml;rchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239-240]</a></span></p>

<p>They called him a child of the gods and a
genius, and knew not that he was a man for
whose soul Sorrow and M&auml;rchen struggled
ceaselessly, and who had suffered so much grief
and seen so many wonders that his strength
was broken. Ay, the children of the gods must
suffer much on earth, and M&auml;rchen only visits
those that have been proved, and ever departs
from them if they have made themselves unworthy
of her. Once she told at parting the tale which
follows:&mdash;

I have been forced to keep the German word, as no
English one covers that peculiar type of German fanciful
stories that are known under this appellation. <i>M&auml;rchen</i>
are something more than fairy tales; something deeper,
wider, richer, and more varied. The queen calls the

<div class="gaptop2" />

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span><span class="smcap">HE</span> Philosopher and the Poet set out
together on a pilgrimage, to seek after
the hidden treasure of cognition<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and to raise it. They had been told that it lay
buried there where the rainbow touches the
earth, and that it was quite easy to find. The
Philosopher dragged instruments with him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
began accurate measurements, and as often as he
saw a rainbow he carefully measured the distance,
determined the spot with mathematical
accuracy, hurried thither and began to dig. The
Poet, meanwhile, laid himself in the grass and
laughed and toyed with the sunbeams. They
played about his happy brow, they told to him
bright fairy tales of dreamland, and showed
him the life and working of nature. He grew
familiar with all plants and creatures, he learnt
to know their speech, and he became versed in
their secret whisperings and sighs. Ay, all
created things came to have faces for him, from
the tenderest plant and the most insignificant
beast, and before his eyes were unrolled deeds
full of woe and joy.</p>

<p>When at last the Philosopher, with solemn
look, torn hands, and weary back, rose from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
his shaft back into daylight, laden with some
new stones, he marveled when he saw the
Poet's face radiant, as though he had heard
wonders.</p>

<p>"How transfigured you are, you lazy one!"
he said angrily.</p>

<p>"Who tells you that I am lazy?"</p>

<p>"You always remain here on the surface while
I go into the depths."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the surface, too, offers some solutions,
and perchance I read these."</p>

<p>"What can the surface offer? One must
penetrate into the depths. I have as yet not
found the right spot in which the promised
treasure lies, but I have made some most important
discoveries, though never yet the right
ones, those that I apprehend."</p>

<p>"Let us seek further," said the Poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he held his friend by the arm, and
pointed with breathless delight.</p>

<p>"Another rainbow!" cried the Philosopher,
and began his measurements.</p>

<p>But the Poet had seen behind the sun-glittering
rainbow a wondrous form with black hair
and large, sad eyes. She seemed to wait for
him; then she turned away slowly. As though
demented, the Poet rushed after her; he forgot
the aim of his pilgrimage, forgot his friend,
who had descended into a new shaft. He only
hurried after that wondrous being whose eyes
had sunk into his soul. Over hill and dale, from
house to house he followed the fair form. He
saw the world and its agonies, wherever he
looked he beheld woe, for in his own heart dwelt
the greatest woe, the gnawing pangs of love.
He ever thought he must attain to his enchantress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
who stepped in front of him so calmly,
through the fallen autumn leaves, across the
soft snow, in the bitter north wind&mdash;north, south,
east, and west, ever unapproachable. Once or
twice she looked round after him, and her gaze
only increased his yearning.</p>

<p>At last Spring neared on the wings of the
wind. At the spot whence the Poet had set
out the fair form halted. Now he should reach
it. But at that moment a hurricane broke loose
that shook the world. Forests were uprooted,
and all the sluices of heaven seemed opened.
The Poet crossed the foaming mountain stream
at the peril of his life, and came up to her who
stood calm amid all this uproar, and only gazed
at him. He seized her hand.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken in me," she said, sadly.
"I wanted to flee from you because I love you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
for I bring you no happiness. I am Sorrow,
and must leave you a heavy heart and serious
thoughts. Farewell! You have found your
treasure; now you need me no longer."</p>

<p>So speaking she vanished.</p>

<p>The hurricane had changed into a fine, drizzling
rain, through which the Spring sunbeams
pierced to the Poet. At that moment the Philosopher
rose out of the earth richly laden. He
let all his burden fall, folded his hands, and
cried&mdash;"Why, you lucky wight, you stand in
the very midst of the rainbow, straight upon
the treasure."</p>

<p>"Who? I?" said the Poet, waking from his
stupor. Then he threw himself to earth and
wept aloud and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh that I had never been born! I suffer
unspeakable torture."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249-250]</a></span></p>

<p>The Philosopher shrugged his shoulders and
began to dig anew.</p>

<p>"There stands one right upon his treasure,"
he said, "and does not know it; and when I tell
him he weeps. Oh these poets!"

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" />
<span class="drop-cap">I</span><span class="smcap"> WANTED</span> to find Truth. Then
Sorrow took me by the hand, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come with me, I will lead you to Truth, but
you must not faint or fear by the way."</p>

<p>"I! I fear nothing; and I am so strong I
could carry mountains."</p>

<p>Sorrow looked at me pityingly, and gave no
answer, but led me into a hall that was vast and
high and airy, filled with wondrous strains of
music, glorious pictures, and statues. I wandered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
among them bewildered. There was
nothing to fear here.</p>

<p>"See," said Sorrow, "here live the Arts; you
may choose one of them. But of your own accord
you must select that which suits you; and
it will help you on the road to Truth."</p>

<p>Then I laid my hand on an instrument&mdash;</p>

<p>"Music tempts me," I said; "I will sing and
play like a god, and it cost me my life and my
happiness."</p>

<p>With what ardor, what fire did I begin to
play! I followed music like an adored mistress.
I besought her to lead me to Truth.
But she ever went too fast or soared above my
head, while I played till my hands failed me.
Song sounded weak and small in my throat, instead
of sobbing and storming. Then I ran into
the Wood in my distress, and it comforted me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Sorrow touched my shoulder.</p>

<p>"You still play badly, you still sing feebly;
let us go further: you are no artist."</p>

<p>I laid aside my instrument and wept.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Sorrow; "you wanted to carry
a mountain."</p>

<p>And she led me into a large, solemn, dimly lit
room, that was full of books from floor to ceiling.</p>

<p>"Here is food for your spirit," said Sorrow;
"seek, seek; in Science lives Truth."</p>

<p>I seated myself in a tall, worn armchair, and
began to learn. But I could only study slowly,
for ever my thoughts would wander their own
ways. Now the fire burned too brightly and
told me fairy tales; now the wind howled round
the old house, so that I thought I must away,
and the letters grew dim to my eyes. I strove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to check this hapless fantasy that held me back
on the road to Truth; but it was stronger than
I. Sometimes it pressed a pencil into my hand,
and then I wrote secretly poor little verses,
which I hid from the very books, from the very
air of the room. At last I threw myself back in
the chair and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wisdom, too, is not for me. She seems to
me dead and dusty, and I&mdash;I desire to live."</p>

<p>"Do you want that?" said Sorrow. "But
then you must not fear."</p>

<p>"I do not fear, I want to live."</p>

<p>Then I stood beside a sick bed, where a lovely
gifted boy struggled with Death. His sufferings
exceeded the measure of the endurable, yet
Sorrow would not quit him. But Courage, too,
remained at his side. Two years the terrible
struggle lasted, and I asked&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is Truth? Is this to live?"</p>

<p>When he died I trembled, for the first time,
for fear. Then Sorrow took me from one deathbed
to another. How many fair maiden flowers
that had grown up beside and with me did I
see fade! And I wept till my eyes were dim.</p>

<p>"Is this to live?" I asked again.</p>

<p>Then Sorrow took me with her on long journeys
to the North, South, East, and West. I
saw all men, all arts, all treasures, the mighty
sea, and the petty towns, till I grew homesick
for the old house in which I had seen so many
die, in which my father had now closed his eyes.
For when I came back I found his armchair
empty. Then I was ready to die of grief.</p>

<p>"What," said Sorrow, "die already? And
you could carry a mountain? Why, you have
not lived yet, for you have not loved."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>While she said this she laid her hand on my
heart, and like a mighty stream love entered in
with song and rejoicing. Only the Wood saw
it, and it rejoiced with me, and yet more secretly
I wrote now and again a little poem.</p>

<p>But Truth was not in love, neither was it in
renunciation, for I murmured and knew not why
I should renounce. Sorrow's hand lay heavy
on my arm, and for a long time my steps were
weak and slow. I no longer sought after Truth.
But at last I seemed to see that she must lie in
Work, in great, rich Work. When Sorrow
heard me say this, she raised my drooping head
and pointed before me.</p>

<p>"Here stands a good man, and waits for you.
Will you love him your life long? Here is your
path, it is rough and stony, and leads past precipices
to steep heights. Will you walk on it?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
And there lies work for you, mountains high.
Will you carry it?"</p>

<p>"I will," I said.</p>

<p>Then Sorrow led me into marriage, and
made me a mother, and laid great rich labors
upon my shoulders. I groped about to find the
right path, and we had to meet with mistrust
and misunderstanding, and on the steep path
stood hate and strife. But I did not fear, for I
was a mother. But not many years was this
high dignity mine, my child's fair eyes closed,
and I laid his curly head in the grave. Yet
I stood erect, notwithstanding the fire in my
breast, and I asked of Sorrow&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where is Truth? Now that all earthly joy,
all earthly hopes have been borne to the grave,
there remains for me nothing but Truth; I have
a right to find her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Sorrow pressed into my hand a pencil,
and said&mdash;"Seek."</p>

<p>And I wrote and wrote, and knew not that
I exercised an art, for years since, I had
with heavy heart renounced being an artist. I
sought to do good where I could. I learnt to
understand men and to think myself into their
innermost being; but I did not find Truth.
My steps once more grew heavy and weary,
until at last, conquered by sickness, I had to lie
down. And during this long illness I tasted all
life's bitterness, all chagrin and despair that can
reside in one poor human breast, and I desired
to die. But Sorrow taught me to be well again,
and ever faster flew my pencil, ever richer
streamed my thoughts, ever wider grew my
field of labor, ever sterner the care for others'
weal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the ground beneath our feet trembled
and War drew nigh with his companions. His
breath was thunder, his eye fire, his hand the
lightning. The cloak that infolded him wrapped
the whole heavens in black night. We staked
life and wealth and honor, and our heart's
blood fell to earth in the terrible struggle,
from which our trusty ones, who stood by us as
firmly as we stood by them, issued victorious.
It was my part to heal the wounds and soften
the sufferings. But neither was Truth here.
True, we came forth from the strife fearless and
purified, but already envy and jealousy lurked
on our path, and made it slippery and unsafe.</p>

<p>"Oh, Truth, Truth," I cried, "my youth is
past; I have fought the hardest fights and I
still live, but I have not yet seen Truth."</p>

<p>"There she stands," said Sorrow, and when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
raised my eyes I saw in the distance, besides a
silent water, a little child whose eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>"Is that child Truth?" I asked.</p>

<p>Sorrow nodded.</p>

<p>"She is not to be feared, is she?"</p>

<p>But while Sorrow spoke thus, the child grew
taller and taller, until she held the whole earth
in her hand, and embraced the whole heavens.</p>

<p>"Do you see Truth," said Sorrow. "And now
look within yourself; she is there too."</p>

<p>And as I gazed within, I cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wherefore have I suffered and fought? she
was ever there, about me, and in me, and now I
will die."</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Sorrow.</p>

<p>Then it grew misty before my eyes, and I saw
nothing more. But Sorrow took me by the
hand, and led me further.</p>
